[Verse]
Oh, I won't cry anymore, now that you've left me
I won't cry anymore, now that you're gone
Oh baby, I've shed a million tears since we've been apart
But tears can never mend, well, my broken, my broken heart
I won't cry anymore, well, I'll just forget you
Oh, I'm closing the door, closing the door of memories
Well, though, though you're the one love that my arms are longing for
This is goodbye, well, I won't cry anymore
