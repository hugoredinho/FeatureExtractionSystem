Till the end of time
Long as stars are in the blue
Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing
I'll go on loving you
Till the end of time
Long as roses bloom in May
My love for you will grow deeper
With every passing day
Till the wells run dry
And each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you, to care for you
Through laughter and through tears
So take my heart in sweet surrender
And tenderly say that I'm
The one you love and live for
Till the end of time
Till the wells run dry
And each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you, to care for you
Through laughter and through tears
So take my heart in sweet surrender
And tenderly say that I'm
The one you love and live for
Till the end of time
