This world is big and wild and half insane
Take me where real animals are playing
Just a dirty old shack
Where the hound dogs bark
That we called our home (Ooooh)
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats

On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home

While I lay my head upon my pillow (Oo-ooh)
Little girl, come play beneath my window (Oo-ooh)
Though she's far from home
She is free from harm
And she need not fear (Ooh)
She is by my side
And the sky is wide
So let the sun shine bright

On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home

Girl, it's a hard, hard world (Oo-oo-ooh)
If it gets you down (Oo-ooh)
Dreams often fade and die (Oo-oo-ooh)
In a bad, bad world (Oo-ooh)

I'll take you where real animals are playing
And people are real people, not just playing
It's a quiet, quiet life
By a dirty old shack
That we called our home (Oooh)
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats

On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
Animal Farm
