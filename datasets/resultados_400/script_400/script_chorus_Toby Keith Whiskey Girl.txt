She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs something' with a little more edge and a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My Ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough

She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs something' with a little more edge and a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
My Ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs something' with a little more edge and a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
My Ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough

Whoa she's my little whiskey girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough
Yeah, I like them rough
I like them rough
