In my daddy's car
It's you I really want to drive
But you never go too far
I may not be your kind of man
I may not be your style
But honey, all I want to do
Is just love you for a little while

I really get a dirty mind
Whenever you're around
It happens to me everytime
You just got to let me lay you
Got to let me lay you, lay you
You just got to let me lay you
Got to let me lay you down

In my daddy's car
It's you I really want to drive
Underneath the stars
I really get a dirty mind
Whenever you're around
I don't want to hurt you, baby
I only want to lay you down
