Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll

Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll
(Hum diddy waddy doo)

Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll
(Hum diddy waddy doo)

Let's hear the high voice wail (oooooooooo)
And hear the voice down low (wah-ah ah-ah)
Let's hear the background
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
