But at night it's a different world
So nice just to be a girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And baby, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer
In the city, in the summer, in the city

But at night it's a different world
So nice just to be a girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And baby, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer
In the city, in the summer, in the city

Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
'Til I'm wheezing just like a bus stop
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you at the rooftop

But at night it's a different world
So nice just to be a girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And baby, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer
In the city, in the summer, in the city
