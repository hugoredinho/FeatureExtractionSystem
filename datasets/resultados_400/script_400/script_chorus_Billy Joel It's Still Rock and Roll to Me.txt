Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set
Of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise
The miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true
Baby blue Continental

Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about
The new fashion honey?
All you need are looks
And a whole lotta money

It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me
