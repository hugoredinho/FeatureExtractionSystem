'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire

It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming
