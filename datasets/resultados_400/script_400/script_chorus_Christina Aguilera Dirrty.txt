Ahh, dirrty, dirrty, filthy, filthy, nasty
Christina, you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirty to clean my act up (Ha, ha)
If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party
Woo, ladies, move, gentleman, move
Somebody ring the alarm, a fire in the room
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
(Who ready to party out there?)
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Where my dawgs at?

Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

Gonna get Rowdy (Rowdy)
Gonna get a little unruly (Unruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (Hurry)
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party (I came to start the party)
