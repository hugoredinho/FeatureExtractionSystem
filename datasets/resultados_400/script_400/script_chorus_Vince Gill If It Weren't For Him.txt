If she only knew what I was thinking
If she only knew what was in head
Why can't she see my heart is breaking
She'd be mine if weren't for him
So many times I've dreamed I had her
I've called her name when I lay down
Still I can't learn to live without her
A jealous heart is all I've found

If he only knew what I was thinking
If he only knew what was in my head
Why can't he see my heart is breaking
He'd be mine if it weren't for him

You'd be mine if it weren't for him
