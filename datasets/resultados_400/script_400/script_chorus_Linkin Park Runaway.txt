[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Mind 
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind 
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind 
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)

I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
