I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, oh

I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, oh

I don't know who you think I am (I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I don't know who you think I am)
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come, I'ma huff and puff and blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this house, house down
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes

I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man

Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
