You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It's broken now
Don't ever look my way
Don't even think I'm playin'

‘Cause I fucking hate you
You're such a liar
And I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me

You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It's broken now
Don't ever look my way
Don't even think I'm playin'

‘Cause I fucking hate you
You're such a liar
And I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me
I fucking hate you
You're such a liar
And I love to hate you
You're all the same to me
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)

You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It's broken now
Don't ever look my way
Don't even think I'm playin'

‘Cause I fucking hate you
You're such a liar
And I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me
And I fucking hate you
You're such a liar
And I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me
Fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you)
