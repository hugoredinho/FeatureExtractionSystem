So real that it's all in my heart, I'm hooked on you, baby
It can't fall apart, I'm hooked on you, baby
I've been loving you, you know it's true
And I'm hooked on you, baby (Hooked on you)

You don't know, I'm hooked on you, baby?
Don't stay too long, I'm hooked on you baby
I've been loving you, and you know it, too
That I'm hooked on you (Hooked on you)
Hey hey, it's all in my heart, I'm hooked on you, baby
Don't fall apart, I'm hooked on you, baby
Just from loving you, I've been proud that it's true
That I'm hooked on you (Hooked on you)
Yeah, oh, oh, baby
