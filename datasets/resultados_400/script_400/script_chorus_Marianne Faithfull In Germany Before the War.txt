I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea
I'm thinking of the sea
I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea

A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of grey
Reflected in his glasses
As he watches her
A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of grey

I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea
Thinking of the sea, I'm thinking of the sea
I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea
