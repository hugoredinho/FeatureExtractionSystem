There is no end to this
I can't turn away another picture
But the scene
Is still the same
There is no room to move
Or try to look away
Remember, life is strange
And life keeps getting stranger every day
A mass of harmless attitudes
An attack that won’t subside
No matter what they say, you knew
Your heart beats you late at night

Your heart beats you late at night
Your heart beats you late at night
Your heart beats you late at night
