I got somethin' to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress

Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress

I got somethin' to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could

You have come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Going to bring green hell
Green hell
