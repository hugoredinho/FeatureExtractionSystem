War zone, war zone
This is where it's going down
War zone, war zone
When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way

War zone, war zone
This is where it's going down
War zone, war zone
When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
