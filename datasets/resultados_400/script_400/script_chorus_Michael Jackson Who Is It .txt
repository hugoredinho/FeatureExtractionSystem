And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can’t take this stuff no more

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

Hee-hee, hee-hee!
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, I never would
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Tell me, I'm bothered!
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
(Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(You can really say I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
(Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
(Don't be, don't do)
Did she find in someone else?
(Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
(This won't cut it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
(Don't be judging)
'Cause I'm bothered every day
(Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
(She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter
(She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away
(Is it my brother?)
And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me, you just couldn't)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
(Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
