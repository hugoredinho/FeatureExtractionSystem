This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me?
Look what you did to me (Oh, baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(Made me cry)
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me

Heartbreak Hotel (Ohh-oh-ohh)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Oh-ohh-ohhh)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (I-i,i, why'd you do it? Yeah-ah)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (All I wanted!)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (This the heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Welcome to heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Yeah, why'd you do it?)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
