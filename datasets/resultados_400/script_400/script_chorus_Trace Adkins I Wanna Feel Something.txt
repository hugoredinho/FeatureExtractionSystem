But I want to feel something
Something that's a real something
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I want a heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's busting at the seams
I want to care, I want to cry, I want to scream
I just want to feel something

But I want to feel something
Something that's a real something
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I want a heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's busting at the seams
I want to care, I want to cry, I want to scream
I just want to feel something

But I want to feel something
Something that's a real something
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I want a heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's busting at the seams
I want to care, I want to cry, I want to scream
I just want to feel something

Come here, baby
