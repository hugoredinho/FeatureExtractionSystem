On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our bones
Our skin
We will not let you in

On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood
Will stay
We will not go away
On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood
Our grace
Will never leave this place

We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
