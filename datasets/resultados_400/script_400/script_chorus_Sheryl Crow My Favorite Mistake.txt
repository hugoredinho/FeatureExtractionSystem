Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh

Did you know when you go, it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I was just beginning?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake

Did you know when you go, it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I've gotten used to spending?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake

Did you know, could you tell
You were the only one that I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong
Did you see me walking by?
Did it ever make you cry?
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
