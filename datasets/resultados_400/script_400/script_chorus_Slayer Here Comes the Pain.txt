Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here
The line starts here

Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here
The line starts here

Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls

Here comes the pain
You're no different from the rest
Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland
Here comes the pain
Your destruction manifests
Lying there broken, looking up as I still stand

Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls
