Do me baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Come on and do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait

Do me baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Come on and do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait

Do, do, do, do me baby
(Do me baby)
Do me baby all night long
(Give it to me)
Do me baby
I want you now
Do me baby
Give it to me
(Do me baby)
Do me baby, don't want to do it all alone
I want your love
Do me baby
Give it to me
(Do me baby)
This feeling is too strong, make me wait too long
(I want you now)
