When you see the smile on his face
Just remember, baby
Could've been you, could've been you
When he's standing there in your place
I hate to say it, baby
Could've been you

When you see the smile on his face
Just remember, baby
Could've been you, could've been you
When he's standing there in your place
I hate to say it, baby
Could've been you

When you see the smile on his face
Just remember, baby
Could've been you, could've been you
When he's standing there in your place
I hate to say it, baby
Could've been you
When you see the smile on his face
Just remember, baby
Could've been you, could've been you
When he's standing there in your place
I hate to say it, baby
Could've been you
