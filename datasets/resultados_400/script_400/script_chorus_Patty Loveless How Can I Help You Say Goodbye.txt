Momma whispered softly, time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same
And she said, how can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you
And I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

I called up momma and she said time will ease your pain
Life's about changin' nothing ever stays the same
And she said, how can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt and it's OK to cry
Come let me hold you
And I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye
