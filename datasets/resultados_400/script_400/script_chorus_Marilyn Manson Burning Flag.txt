We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
