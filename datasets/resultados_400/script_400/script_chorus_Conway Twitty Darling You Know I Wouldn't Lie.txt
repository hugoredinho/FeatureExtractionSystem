Here I am late again for the last time
And like I promised, I just told her goodbye
Please, believe me for this time it's really over
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie

Didn't I come and tell you about her
How temptation lured she and I
But now I know it was only fascination
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie

She wanted to hold me forever
And this lipstick shows her final try
And these tears on my shoulder
Are proof that she failed
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie...
