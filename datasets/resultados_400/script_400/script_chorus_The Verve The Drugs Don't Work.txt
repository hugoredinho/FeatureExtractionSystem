And I hope you're thinking of me
As you lay down on your side
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
