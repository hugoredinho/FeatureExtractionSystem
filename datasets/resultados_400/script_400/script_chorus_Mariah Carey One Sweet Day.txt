And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven)

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way (Lost along the way)
And I know eventually we'll be together (Oh, no, I know)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven)

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day (One sweet day)
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Yes, we will)
(One sweet day) One sweet day

Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say
