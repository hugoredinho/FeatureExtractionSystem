Don't you know that
I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
You are my sunlight after the rain
Wherever You are
I just wanna be near You
I'm so glad I can hear You

Don't You know that
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

Don't You know that
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You
