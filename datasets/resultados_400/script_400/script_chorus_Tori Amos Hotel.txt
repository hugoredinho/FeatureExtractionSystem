You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?

Give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me more

I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash

You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now

I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash

You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild
