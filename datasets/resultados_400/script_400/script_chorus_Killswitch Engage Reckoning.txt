You are no god to me
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning

You are no god to me
This is a reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning

You are no god to me
This is a reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning
And I will be there
To see you fall
You are no god to me
There is the reckoning

You are no god to me
This is the reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning
And I will be there
To see you fall
You are no god to me
There is a reckoning
