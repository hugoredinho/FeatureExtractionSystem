What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand
Better count your fingers

What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears
And the only consequences are dread and the fugitive mind

What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand
Better count your fingers

What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears
And the only consequences are dread and the fugitive mind
