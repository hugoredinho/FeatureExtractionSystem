Cause he had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence

With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put them all together and what have you got confidence

Cause he had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence

You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
How do you know that you can't ride
A rainbow in the sky
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try

All we need is confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence

With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put them all together and what have you got confidence
