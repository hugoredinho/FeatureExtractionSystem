Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days
