It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
