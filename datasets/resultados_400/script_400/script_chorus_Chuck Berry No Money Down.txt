I'm going to get me a car
And I'll be headed on down the road
Then I won't have to worry
About that broken down, ragged Ford

Yes I'm going to get that car
And I'm going to head on down the road
Yeah, then I won't have to worry
About that broken down, ragged Ford

I got me a car
And I'm headed on down the road
No money down I don't have to worry
About that broken down, ragged Ford
