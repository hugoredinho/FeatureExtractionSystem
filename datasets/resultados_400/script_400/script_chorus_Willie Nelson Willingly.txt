Willingly I fell although I knew
Sweetheart I knew the same as you
So if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly

I love you, I love you too
I want you, I want you too
But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly

I love you, I love you too
I want you, I want you too
But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly
