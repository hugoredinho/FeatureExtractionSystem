You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little somethin'-somethin' didn't go your way (yeah)
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way (come on!)
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck, if you're evadin' the space
So getcha-getcha groove on (gotta getcha groove on)
Don't keep us waitin' too long (don't keep us waitin' too long)
