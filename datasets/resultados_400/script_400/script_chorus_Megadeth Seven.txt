Hid beneath disguises
Judge the world within
Forgive my deadly sins

Seven deadly sins of mine

On every street and corner lie

On every street (greed)
And corner lie (pride)

The seven deadly sins of mine
On every street (envy)
And corner lie (wrath)
These seven (sloth)
Deadly (lust) sins of mine
Deadly sins of mine
Seven deadly sins...
These deadly sins of mine...
Deadly sins of mine!
