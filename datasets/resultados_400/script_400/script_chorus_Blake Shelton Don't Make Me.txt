Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Don't make me (Don't make me)

Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

(Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go)
Don't make me
Stop lovin' you
(Don't make me)
Stop needin' you
