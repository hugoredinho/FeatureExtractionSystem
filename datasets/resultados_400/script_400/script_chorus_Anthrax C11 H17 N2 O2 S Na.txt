You're in total control
And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up

You're in total control
And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up

Cop to it, cop to it
Cop to it, cop to it
You're in total control
And you're still a liar
Cop to it, cop to it
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
Cop to it, cop to it
I can't drink from the cup
Cop to it, 'fess up
I can't drink from the cup
Cop to it, 'fess up
I can't drink from the cup
Cop to it, 'fess up
I can't drink from the cup
Cop to it, 'fess up
