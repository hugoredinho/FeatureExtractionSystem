I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart
