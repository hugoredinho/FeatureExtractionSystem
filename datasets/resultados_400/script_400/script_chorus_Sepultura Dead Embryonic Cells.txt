Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

We're born
With pain
No more
We're dead
Embryonic cells

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're dead
