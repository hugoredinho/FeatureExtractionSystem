Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything is fighting about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything is fighting about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything is fighting about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
