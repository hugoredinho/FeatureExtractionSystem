We're being sucked up
Into the vacuum culture
This way this way
It's too late
Your addicted
Come on control yourself
Snatch that bottle off the shelve
You're trapped now with spiritual law
Spiritual law

Man don't lie why do they cry
Man don't lie why do they cry
Man don't lie why do they cry

You're hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it

Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today
Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today

Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today
Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today
