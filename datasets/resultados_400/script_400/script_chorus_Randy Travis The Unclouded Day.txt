Oh, they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
They tell me of a home far away
Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day

Oh, the land of cloudless days
Oh, the land of an uncloudy sky
Oh, they tell me of a land where no storm clouds rise
Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day

Oh, the land of cloudless days
Oh, the land of an uncloudy sky
Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day
Oh, the land of cloudless days
Oh, the land of an uncloudy sky
Oh, they tell me of a land where no storm clouds rise
Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day
