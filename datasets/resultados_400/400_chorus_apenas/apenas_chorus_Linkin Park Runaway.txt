I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind
