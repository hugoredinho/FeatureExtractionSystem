I wasn’t looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There’s some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it comin’
How’d you learn to do the things you do?
