Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (Whoa)
And I show you who's the boss (Whoa)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hanging on your cross

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (Whoa)
And I show you who's the boss (Whoa)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hanging on your cross

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (Whoa)
And I show you who's the boss (Whoa)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hanging on your cross
