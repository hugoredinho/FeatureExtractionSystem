I never dreamed that you would leave me
But now you're gone
I never dreamed that I would miss you
Woman won't you come back home

I never dreamed I could feel so empty
But now I'm down
I never dreamed that I would beg you
Woman I need you now

I never knew about sweet love
So woman won't you come back home
Oh baby won't you come back home
