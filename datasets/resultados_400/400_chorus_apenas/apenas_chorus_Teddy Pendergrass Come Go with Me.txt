Come on and go with me, I'd sure like that, baby
Come on over to my place, it would be so nice, it would be so good
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

Come on and go with me, would you do that, baby?
Come on over to my place, would you do that, baby? Would you do that, baby?
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

Come on and go with me, come on, baby
(No)
Come on over to my place
(No, not tonight, no)
You see it's not far from here
(I believe you)
Would you just take a minute and think about it?
(Oh, man)
Would you just think about it, think about it? Yeah
(I'm thinkin' about it but I really have to say no)
