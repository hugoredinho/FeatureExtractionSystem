Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound, we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound, we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound, we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die
