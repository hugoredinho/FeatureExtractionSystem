Yes, they'll all come to meet me
All creatures smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home
