It's a young man's town
Full of young man's dreams
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings
And sometimes you gotta stand back
And watch 'em burn it to the ground
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town

It's a young man's town
Full of young man's dreams
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings
And sometimes you gotta stand back
And watch 'em burn it to the ground
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town
