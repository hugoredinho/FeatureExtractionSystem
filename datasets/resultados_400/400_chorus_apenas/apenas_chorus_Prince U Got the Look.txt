You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If your love is good, let's get to rammin' now
You got the look, you got the look
