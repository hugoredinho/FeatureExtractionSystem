Pray until your number, asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting, tomorrow's turned up dead

Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals

Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals
