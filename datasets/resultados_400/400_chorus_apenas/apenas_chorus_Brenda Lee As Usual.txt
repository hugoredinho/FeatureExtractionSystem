But I can't find the way to let
This crazy heart of mine forget
I pretend you're still beside me
As usual

People always stop and stare
I guess they just don't see you there
Don't they know you'll always be right here
As usual

And as I stood there telling lies
The tears began to fill my eyes
'Cause I know I'm only fooling myself
As usual
