I said the joint was rocking
Uh, going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

I said the joint was a rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
And they go on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
