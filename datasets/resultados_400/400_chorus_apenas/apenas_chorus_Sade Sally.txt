So put your hands together for Sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for them
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world one angry day, in New York

So put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for Sally
She was there when his luck was running thin
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry day, in New York

So put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for Sally
She was there when his luck was running thin
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry day, in New York
