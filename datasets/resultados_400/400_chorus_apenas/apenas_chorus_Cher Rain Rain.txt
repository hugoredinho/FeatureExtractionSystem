Rain, rain in the sky
Everywhere I look my eyes see
Rain, rain fallin' down
Crying as it hits the ground
Rain, rain in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Rain, rain
Falling rain

Rain, rain in the sky
Everywhere I look my eyes see
Rain, rain fallin' down
Crying as it hits the ground
Rain, rain in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Rain, rain
Falling rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Falling rain

Everywhere I look I see the rain
Everywhere I look I see the rain
But I don't see you
You're not near me
I need you... ooh
Rain
It'll never be the same
If you don't stop the rain
