You were always so far away
I know that pain, so don't you run away
Like you used to do

You were always so far away
I know that pain, I won't run away
Like I used to do

You were always so far away
I know the way, so don't you run away
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
