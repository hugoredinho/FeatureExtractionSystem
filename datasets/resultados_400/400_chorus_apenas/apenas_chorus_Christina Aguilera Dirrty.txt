Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

Rowdy

It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
