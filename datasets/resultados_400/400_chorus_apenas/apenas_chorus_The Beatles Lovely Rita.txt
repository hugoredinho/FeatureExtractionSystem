Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
