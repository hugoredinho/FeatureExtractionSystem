Say you don't love him, my salamander
Why do you need him?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart

When will you see me, my salamander?
Don't try to tell me
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart

I'm getting closer, my salamander
When will we be there?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart
