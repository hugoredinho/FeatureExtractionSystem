Lord, how long have I got to keep on running?
Seven hours, seven days or seven years?
All I know is, since you've been gone
Feel like I'm drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river

Still I catch myself thinking
One day I'll find my way back here
You'll save me from drowning
Drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river
Lord, how long must it go on?
