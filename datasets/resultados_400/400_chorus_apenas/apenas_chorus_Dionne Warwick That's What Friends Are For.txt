Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
In good times, in bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
Oh, that's what friends are for, oh

Oh, keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for

Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me, oh, for sure
'Cause I tell you that's what friends are for
For good times and for bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore, oh
That's what friends are for
