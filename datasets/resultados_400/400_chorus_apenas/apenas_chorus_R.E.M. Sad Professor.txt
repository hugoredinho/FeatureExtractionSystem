Late afternoon, the house is hot
I started, I jumped up
Everyone hates a bore
Everybody hates a drunk

Late afternoon, the house is hot
I started, I jumped up
Everyone hates a sad professor
I hate where I wound up

Late afternoon, the house is hot
I started, I jumped up
Everyone hates a bore
Everybody hates a drunk
Everyone hates a sad professor
I hate where I wound up
I hate where I wound up
