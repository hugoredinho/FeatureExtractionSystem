I try to entertain you the best I can
I wish I'd started walking before I ran
But I still love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop 'cause it gets me through yeah
It gets me through yeah

I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the anti-Christ or the iron man
But I still love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop 'cause it gets me through yeah
