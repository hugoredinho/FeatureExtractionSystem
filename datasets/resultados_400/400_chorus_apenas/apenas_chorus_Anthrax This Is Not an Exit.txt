This is not an exit
I can never change it
This is not an exit
It's no way out

This is not an exit
I can never change it
This is not an exit
It's no way out
It's no way out
There's no way out
It's no way out

This is not an exit
This is not an exit
This is not an exit
This is not an exit
I can never change it
You stop and then you take it
I stop and I can't fake it
This is not an exit

This is not an exit (not an exit)
This is not an exit (not an exit)
I can never change it
This is not an exit
Hand over fist
Come and taste my dark trick
Hand over fist
Kill you when I give it
This is not an exit (not an exit)
This is not an exit (not an exit)
I can never change it
This is not an exit
