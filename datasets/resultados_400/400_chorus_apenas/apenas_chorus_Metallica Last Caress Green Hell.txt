Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress

Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress
Last caress, sweet death
Yo
Yo

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
