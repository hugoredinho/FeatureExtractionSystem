Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Ooh)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (Baby)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (No)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)

If I wanna floss, I got my own
