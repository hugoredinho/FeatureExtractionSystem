Hello sunshine
(Hello)
So glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine
(Hello)
It's been dark for a very long time

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place
(Lonely)
And without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space
(My heart)
Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
The wonders of spring
Don't mean a thing

The world is such a lonely place

And without you sunshine

My heart was filled with an empty space
(My heart)
Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
The wonders of spring
Don't mean a thing
