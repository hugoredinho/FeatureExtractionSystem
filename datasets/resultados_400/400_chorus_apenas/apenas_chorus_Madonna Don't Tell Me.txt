Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But please don't tell me to stop

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
(Don't you ever) Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop
