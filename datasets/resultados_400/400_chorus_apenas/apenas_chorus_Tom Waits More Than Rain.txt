None of our pockets are lined with gold
Nobody's caught the bouquet
There are no dead presidents we can fold
Nothing is going our way
And its more than trouble I've got myself into
It's more than woe-begotten gray skies now

None of our pockets are lined with gold
Nobody's caught the bouquet
There are no dead presidents we can fold
Nothing is going our way
And it's more than goodbye I have to say to you
It's more than woe-begotten gray skies now
And it's more than goodbye I have to say to you
It's more than woe-begotten gray skies now
And it's more than woe-begotten gray skies now
