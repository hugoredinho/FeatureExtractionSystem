Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody help me understand

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody...
