Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was
Shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels
In love
So what
Big deal

Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was
I swear if I hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels
In love
So what
Big deal

Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was
Shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels
In love
So what
Big deal
In love
So what
Big deal
Big deal
Oh, yeah!
