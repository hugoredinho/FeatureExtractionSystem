My victims are rich or poor
Young or old, strong or weak
I cause millions of accidents
I am cancer in your bones
I fathered the lie, twist what you say
Speak not the truth
I am insidious, impartial
Deep inside your chromosomes
I take what you love
And leave you in tears
I imprison your soul
Your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride
My promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake
I dance with the flames
I bring poverty, sickness and death
A worthless handshake
The slickest thief, I steal your wealth
I answer your prayers for greed and lust
More than evil, I laugh at your trust
I am more powerful
Than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence
More deadly than death
I have destroyed more men
Than all the nation's wars
I am relentless, unpredictable
Waiting for your last breath

Evil, more evil than violence
Violent, more violent than death
Deadly, more deadly than man
I am, yeah, yeah, I'm evil, I am!

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

I take what you love, and leave you in tears
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake I dance with the flames

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The most beautiful angel
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The most beautiful angel
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness
Unpredictable, the prince of darkness
Prince of darkness
