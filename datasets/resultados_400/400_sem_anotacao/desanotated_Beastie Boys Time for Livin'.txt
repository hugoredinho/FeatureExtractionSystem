Yeah, that's right!
It's time, to set the record straight

Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear

Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'

Check this out
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear

Soul fire, soul fire
And we ain't got no water
We don't got no water

Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to sell
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to sell
