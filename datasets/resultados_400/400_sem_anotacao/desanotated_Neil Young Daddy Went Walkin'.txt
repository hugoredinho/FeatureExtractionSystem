My old dad went a walking one day
Pushing tall weeds
Right outta his way
My old dad went a walking one day

Hey now, hey now

Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right

Hey now, hey now

Old man crossing the road
You've got to let him go
Old man crossing the road
He's feeling fine

Daddy went a riding in his old car
Took the dog with him
Cause it ain't too far
Daddy went riding in his old car
Hey now, hey now

Brown leather boots
And an old straw hat
Daddy's getting wood
With the barnyard cat
Got a little dirty
But that's all right
Hey now, hey now

Old man crossing the road
You've got to let him go
Old man crossing the road
He's feeling fine

Mama's waiting
At the top of the hill
They'll be laughing
Oh the stories they'll tell
When he holds her
In his arms again
They'll be sweethearts
With time on their hands

My old dad went a walking one day
Pushing tall weeds
Right outta his way
My old dad went a walking one day

Hey now, hey now

Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right

Hey now, hey now

Daddy went a riding in his old car
Took the dog with him
Cause it ain't too far
Daddy went riding in his old car
Hey now, hey now

Brown leather boots
And an old straw hat
Daddy's getting wood
With the barnyard cat
Got a little dirty
But that's all right
Hey now, hey now
