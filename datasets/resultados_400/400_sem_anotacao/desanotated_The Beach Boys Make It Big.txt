Make it big
So big

You can make it big
You can make it bigger than life
See your name spelled right
Up on the bright lights
Bright lights

Have a little faith in yourself
In everything that you do
I know you're going to make it big if you want to
If you really want to
You can make it big

Bright lights

Have a little faith in yourself
In everything that you do
I know you're going to make it big if you want to
If you really want to
You can make it big

Baby you're a superstar
Looking like you're going far
Do what you want
Why don't you do what you want to
You could be my little movie queen
Up there on the silver screen
Do what you want
Go on and do what you want to
Catch a plane to Hollywood
And right away you're best buddys
With Johnny B. Goode
And he say
"Baby welcome to the neighborhood"
Now you can do what you want
Do what you wanna

You can make it big
You can make it bigger than life
See your name spelled right
Up on the bright lights
Bright lights

Bright lights

Have a little faith in yourself
In everything that you do
I know you're going to make it big if you want to
If you really want to
You can make it big

Bright lights

Have a little faith in yourself
In everything that you do
I know you're going to make it big if you want to
If you really want to
You can make it big

Darling you can make it
