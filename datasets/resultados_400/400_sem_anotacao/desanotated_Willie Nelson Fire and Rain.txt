Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susan and the plans they made put an end to you
Walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

Oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you again

You got to look down upon me Jesus you got  help me make a stand
You just gotta see me through another day
My body is aching and my time is at hand I won't make it any other way

I've been working my mind through an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
And there's hours of time on the telephone lines to talk about the things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines and pieces on the ground

Oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you again
