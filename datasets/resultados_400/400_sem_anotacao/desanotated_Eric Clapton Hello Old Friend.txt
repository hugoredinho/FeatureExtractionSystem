As I am strolling down the garden path
I saw a flower glowing in the dark
It looked so pretty and it was unique
I had to bend down just to have a peek

Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

I saw you walking underneath the stars
I could not stop cause I was in a car
I am sure the distance would not be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are

Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

An old man passed me on the street today
I thought I knew him but I could not say
I stopped to think if I could place his frame
When he tipped his hat I knew his name
