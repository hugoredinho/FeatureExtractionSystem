If I was Jesus, I'd have some real long hair
A robe and some sandals, is exactly what I'd wear
I'd be the guy at the party, turning water to wine
Yeah me and my disciples, we'd have a real good time

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (Whoa)
And I show you who's the boss (Whoa)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hanging on your cross

If I was Jesus
I'd have some friends that were poor
I'd run around with the wrong crowd, man I'd never be bored
Then I'd heal me a blind man, get myself crucified
By politicians and preachers, who got something to hide

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (Whoa)
And I show you who's the boss (Whoa)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hanging on your cross

If I was Jesus, I'd come back from the dead
And I'd walk on some water, just to mess with your head
I know your dark little secrets, I'd look you right in the face
And I'd tell you I love you, with Amazing Grace

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (Whoa)
And I show you who's the boss (Whoa)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hanging on your cross

If I Was Jesus
