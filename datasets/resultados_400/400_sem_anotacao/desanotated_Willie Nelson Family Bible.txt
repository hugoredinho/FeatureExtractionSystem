There's a family Bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings, one by one

I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
"Rock of ages
Rock of ages, cleft for me"

Now this old world
Of ours is full of trouble
And this old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing rock of ages, cleft for me

I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me
