Lipstick letter 'cross the mirror this mornin'
Said, "Goodbye, baby," you left without warnin'
Like a thief in the night, you ran away with my heart
I can't believe my eyes, must be a bad dream
You always said we had a good thing
You never once let on we were fallin' apart

That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, was it all a lie
After all this time, that ain't no way to go

Gettin' nowhere, I'm tired of thinkin'
Guess I'll do a little wishful dreamin'
And make a whiskey wish upon a star
Train whistle blowin' down the track
Lonesome sound says she ain't comin' back
It's such a cold blow from out of the dark

That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, now was it all a lie
After all this time...

That ain't no way to go, now girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, now was it all a lie
After all this time, that ain't no way to go
