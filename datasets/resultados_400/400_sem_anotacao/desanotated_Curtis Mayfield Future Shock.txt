Future shock
Ooh hoo

Hey, little sister, where's your brother?
See your mother standing on the soup line
God bless your father
Ain't got the strength to be bothered
The almighty world hear me now
Was bound to weigh him down

We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock
Future shock, future shock

All worldly figures playing on niggers
Oh, see them passing
See how they're dancing to the superfly
Oh, ain't it wrong when you don't know where we come from
Dancing in our youth
Dying at the truth, to get over
(Over, over, get over)

We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock
Future shock, future shock

The price of the meat
Higher than the dope in the street
Is it any wonder
For those with nothing to eat?

We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock
Future shock, future shock
