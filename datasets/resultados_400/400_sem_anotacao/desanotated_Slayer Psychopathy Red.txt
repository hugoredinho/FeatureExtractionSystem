Body count
Laid out mutilated
It's your time to die
Desolate
Lure kill satisfaction
Climax with your death
All alone
My prey intimidated
Feed my lust for fear
Dehumanise
Cry out stimulated
Your screams fill my soul

Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification

Graphic dreams
Played out insatiable
Can't control the urge
Innocence
Drop dead suicidal
A pain that I posses
Vindictive
Past crimes insidious
This is my redemption
Violate
Force down penetrate
Your eyes reflecting horror

Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification

Perversion
Slow death agonizing
Stab around the eyes
Flow of blood
Warm taste brings me pleasure
Eclipsing all reason
Pushing sperm
In her imitation
Painful act in vain
Organs cooked, bled out potency
Now I am complete

Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification
