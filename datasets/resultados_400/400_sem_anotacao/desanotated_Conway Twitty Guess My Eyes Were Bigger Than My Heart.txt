I saw her and told myself
She was my dream come true
Let my eyes deceive me
From the start

They told me I wanted her
More than I wanted you
Guess my eyes were bigger
Than my heart

Wasn't I the foolish one
Lord above, what have I done
For her love
I tore our world apart
Now she's here but it's no good
I don't care the way I should
Guess my eyes were bigger
Than my heart

I allowed these eyes of mine
To lead me into sin
Made me think
That I could love her true

Now she stands out in the cold
My heart won't let her in
There was only room
Enough for you

Wasn't I the foolish one
Lord above, what have I done
For her love
I tore our world apart
Now she's here but it's no good
I don't care the way I should
Guess my eyes were bigger than my heart
