In Germany before the war
There was a man who owned a store
In nineteen hundred thirty four
In DÃ¼sseldorf
And every night at 5:09
He'd cross the park down to the Rhine
And he'd sit there by the shore

I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea
I'm thinking of the sea
I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea

A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of grey
Reflected in his glasses
As he watches her
A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of grey

I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea
Thinking of the sea, I'm thinking of the sea
I'm looking at the river, but I'm thinking of the sea

We lie beneath the autumn sky
My little golden girl and I
And she lies very still
