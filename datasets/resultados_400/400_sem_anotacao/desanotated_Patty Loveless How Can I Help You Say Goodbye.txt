Through the back window of a '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jaime slippin' further away
I kept on wavin', till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay

Momma whispered softly, time will ease your pain
Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same
And she said, how can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt and it's OK to cry
Come, let me hold you
And I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

I sit on our bed, he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were tremblin', we both were cryin'
He kissed me gently and then quickly walked away

I called up momma and she said time will ease your pain
Life's about changin' nothing ever stays the same
And she said, how can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt and it's OK to cry
Come let me hold you
And I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye

Sittin' with momma, alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes, and then squeezed my hand
She said I have to go now, my time here is over
And with her final words she tried to help me understand

Momma whispered softly time will ease your pain
Life's about changin' nothing ever stays the same
And she said, how can I help you to say goodbye
It's OK to hurt and it's OK to cry come let me hold you
And I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye
