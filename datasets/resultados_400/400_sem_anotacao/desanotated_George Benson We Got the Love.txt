You know it hurts me when I can't be next to you
And though we're young I know you feel the same way, too
Deep in our hearts we know it's just a matter of time
'Cause we'll be together one day

And when we met out on the streets along the way
It wasn't by chance that we were passing by that day
As sure as there's a moon and stars above I know
We'll be together for sure

As sure as that nose on your face
We were meant for each other's arms
Just as one and one make two
You were made for me
I was made for you

Don't try to hide that smile I know that's on your face
And when you stare at me I'll look the other way
And we won't give away what we know from the start
That we've got that love in our hearts

As sure as that nose on your face
We were meant for each other's arms
Just as one and one make two
You were made for me
I was made for you

Don't try to hide that smile I know that's on your face
And when you look at me I'll look the other way
And we won't give away what we know from the start
That we've got that love in our hearts

Deep in our hearts
In our hearts we've got that love
In our hearts we've got that love
In our hearts we've got that love
Oh, deep down in our hearts
We've got that love
Oh, we're very into lovin', yeah
Oh that love in our hearts
We've got that love in our hearts
Oh baby, we've got that love
