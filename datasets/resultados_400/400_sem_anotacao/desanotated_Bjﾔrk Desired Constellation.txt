It's tricky when
You feel someone
Has done something
On your behalf
It's slippery when
Your sense of justice
Murmurs underneath
And is asking you:

How am I going to make it right?
How am I going to make it right?

With a palm full of stars
I throw them like dice (repeatedly)
On the table (repeat, repeatedly)
I shake them like dice
And throw them on the table
Repeatedly (repeatedly)
Until the desired constellation appears

How am I going to make it right?
How am I going to make it right?
How am I going to make it right?
(And you hear: how am I going to make it right?)
How am I going to make it right?
How am I going to make it right?
(How am I going to make it right?)
