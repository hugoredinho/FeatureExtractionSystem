Oh

You're my favorite, of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
Yes, you're my favorite, of my favors
You're my razor, oh no

Hey!
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
Come
Come
Come

You're my favorite, of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
Yes, you're my favorite, of my favors
You're my razor, oh no

Hey!
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
Come
Come
Come

You're my favorite, of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
Yes, you're my favorite, of my favors
You're my razor, oh no

Hey!
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
Come
Come
Come
