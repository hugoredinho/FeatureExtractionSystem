I almost felt you touchin' me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then I feel so bad
And I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowin' somewhere every day
Tell me things get better somewhere up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
The sad songs for us to bear

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
And I wish they all could make you smile
Coming home soon and I want to stay
Maybe we can somehow get away
And I wish you could come with me when I go again

If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If you could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights
