Black shadow hanging over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison running through your veins

Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

Black widow weaving evil notions
Dark secrets being spun in your web
Good men going down in your ocean
They can't swim 'cause they're tied to your bed

Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

You just cry wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom, ha ha
Oh, black widow

Come on, weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got him tied to your bed
With your dark, dark secrets
And your green, green eyes
You black widow

Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

You're so bad
