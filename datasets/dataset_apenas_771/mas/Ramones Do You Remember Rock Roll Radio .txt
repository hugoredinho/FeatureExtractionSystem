[Intro]
This is rock and roll radio, come on; let's rock and roll with the Ramones
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go

[Verse]
Do you remember Hullabaloo
Upbeat
, 
Shindig
 and 
Ed Sullivan
 too?
Do you remember rock and roll radio?
Do you remember rock and roll radio?
Do you remember 
Murray the K
Alan Freed
, and high energy?
It's the end, the end of the 70's
It's the end, the end of the century
Do you remember lying in bed
With your covers pulled up over your head?
Radio playing so no one can see
We need change, we need it fast
Before rock's just part of the past
Because lately it all sounds the same to me
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh

[Outro]
Will you remember 
Jerry Lee
John Lennon, 
T. Rex
 and OI 
Moulty
?
It's the end, the end of the 70's
It's the end, the end of the century
