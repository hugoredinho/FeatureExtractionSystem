[Instrumental Intro]

Part 1: Recipe for Hate

[Verse 1]
Each day, my shortcomings pick my pockets
My faults were letters carved in stone
As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone
In a broken mold they made me
The black sheep of the family
Worth less than zero
My opinion and room temperature IQ
I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear
Watch it twist my measly brain mad

[Verse 2]
Talk about me when my back is turned
Next time we meet, it will be too late
The memory burnt in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate, taste it
Dark clouds on the horizon make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake
But every time I run away
I just come back for more
The choice is clear
I can quit and fall on my sword
Or light a fire to see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

[Instrumental Break]

Part 2: Warhorse

[Verse]
I'm feeling quite invisible
I feel just like thin air
The truth taunts me
That nobody wants me
I see the Earth below me
I watch it spin there
Does someone
Somewhere out there hear me?
Sentenced to walk in purgatory
My life is running down
I can't believe what they've done to me
I'm left riding a warhorse
A man without a country

[Instrumental Outro]
