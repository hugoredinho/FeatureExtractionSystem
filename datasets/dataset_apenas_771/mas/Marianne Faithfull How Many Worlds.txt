[Verse 1: Marianne Faithful]
Thinking of a world and the light of the sun
And all the many lives that were ever begun
Ever begun

[Verse 2: Marianne Faithful]
Our little world turning in the blue
As each day goes there's another one new
Another one new

[Verse 3: Marianne Faithful]
How many people will we feed today
How many lips will we kiss today
If we wake up?

[Verse 4: Marianne Faithful]
How many worlds will we ever see
And how people can we ever be
If we wake up?

[Verse 5: Marianne Faithful & Teddy Thompson]
Thinking of a world in the light of the sun
And all the many lives that were ever begun
Ever begun
Ever begun
Ever begun
