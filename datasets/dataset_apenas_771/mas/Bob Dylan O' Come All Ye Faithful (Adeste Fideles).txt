[Verse 1]
Adeste fideles, laeti triumphantes
Venite, venite in Bethlehem
Natum videte
Regem angelorum

Venite, adoremus
Venite, adoremus
Venite, adoramus
Dominum

[Verse 2]
O' come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
Oo come ye, o' come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord

[Verse 3]
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord
