[Intro]
I can't stop
I just can't stop

[Verse 1]
I can't stop
I just can't stop from loving you
I can't stop my hands from holding you
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no
You and me, you and me

[Verse 2]
I can't stop
I just can't stop holding you
And I can't quit a love like this from consuming you
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no
Me loving you, you loving me

[Bridge]
Your love is more than I deserve
Oh baby, you made me, you gave me your love

[Outro]
Oh, I just can't stop
No, I can't stop from loving you
You keep me hanging on
Whatever I do
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no, no, I
No, I can't stop; no, I can't stop
And no, I can't stop, just can't stop
Oh baby, and no, I can't stop, just can't stop
Oh yeah
I know I can't stop, just can't stop
I keep loving you, I keep loving you
No, I can't stop
