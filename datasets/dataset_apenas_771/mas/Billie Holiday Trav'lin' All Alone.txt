[Verse 1]
I'm so weary and all alone
Feel all tired like heavy stone
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

[Verse 2]
Who will see and who will care
'Bout this load that I must bear?
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

[Verse 3]
Prayers I sent to heaven above
'Bout my burdens, woes and love
Head bowed down with misery
Nothin' now appeals to me
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

[Verse 4]
Give me just another day
There's one thing I want to say
Friends do well when all is gold
Leave you always when you're old
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
All alone
