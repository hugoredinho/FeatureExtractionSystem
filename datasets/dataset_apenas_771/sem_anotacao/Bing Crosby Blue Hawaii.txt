Night and you and Blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me
Oh, lovely you and Blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness there should be love
Come with me while the moon is on the sea
The night is young and so are we
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you
