You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love could drive a girl insane
You broke my will, oh but what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

I like that love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you move me, honey
I change my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Ooh kiss me baby, ooh it feels good
Ooh hold me, hold me
I would love to love you like a lover should
'Cause you're fine and so kind
I tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
You broke my will, but I love you still
And goodness gracious great balls of fire

Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Ooh kiss my baby, ooh it feels good
Ooh hold me baby
You ought to love me like a lover should
'Cause you're fine and so kind
I tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I love that love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me, honey
I changed my mind, this love is sure fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Ooh kiss me baby, ooh it feels good
Ooh hold me, hold me
You want love me like a lover should
'Cause you're fine and so kind
I tell the world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
