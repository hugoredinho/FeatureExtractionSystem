As simple as breathing, I picture your face
All tangled in daydreams, and she'll live with grace
I feel you beside me, again
Wherever you may be
Lift up your head for me
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you
If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out
Across the wilderness, from me to you
Certain as sunrise, your image unwinds
Your clearer than crystal, you fill up my mind
Now I have you by my side
Wherever you may be
Lift up your head for me
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you
Though continents divide, and lonely thoughts collide
All heaven will allow, no distance now
I can always close my eyes, take your abstance by surprise
Hold my breath and make peace
)
As simple as breathing, I picture your face
All tangled in daydreams, she'll live in grace
There's somewhere in my heart only for you
If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out
Across this wilderness, from me to you
Wherever you may be (Wherever you may be)
Lift up your head for me (Lift up your head)
There's somewhere in my heart(somewhere in my heart)only for you
If I must do without (If I must do without)
I'll let these sparks fly out (oooh)
Across this wilderness from me to you (Across this wilderness from me to you)
Wherever you may be...
