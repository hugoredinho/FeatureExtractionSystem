If I was a seagull high and aloof
I'd sail to your house, perch on your roof
But I ain't a seagull, you know my name
And the wind's blow fortune, wind's blow pain

And so it goes, nobody knows
How to get to the sky
How to get to the sky

If I was a puppy dog in the early dawn
I'd make it to your house and sleep on your lawn
But I ain't a puppy dog, you know my name
And the wind's blow fortune, the wind's blow pain

And so it goes, nobody knows
How to get to the sky
How to get to the sky

How to get to the sky
How to get to the sky
