G: You always said someday you'd go to live
B: In Southern California
G: And me I'd stay right here in Tennessee
G:You always talked about the better days
B: In Southern California
G: But if you'll stay in Tennessee
G: I promise there'll be better days with me
T: It's not that I don't love you
T: But I hear the call
B: From Southern California
T: There's something I can't find in Tennessee
Silver screens and limousines
They wait for me in Southern California
Though you've been so good to me
The time has come you'll have to set me free
G: Tomorrow when you leave
G: You'll take my heart
B: To Southern California
G: But just remember I'll be here
G: To keep your heart with me until you see
(Tammy spoken)
Well, it's been five years
I guess I've cried a million tears
Lookin' out the window of this little room
Right over that flashin' neon sign that says, "Bar"
It's almost midnight
An time to go downstairs and go to work
I wonder how he's doin' in, Tennessee?
(George spoken)
Well, here I sit by the window
Of this big old lonely mansion
Lookin' out over the Smokies
And on in everything I can see
Oh, I guess by now she's found
What she was lookin' for
And as I look at this old faded photograph
Of the girl that I still love
I wonder if she ever, thinks of me
B: But the weather's good
B: In Southern California...
