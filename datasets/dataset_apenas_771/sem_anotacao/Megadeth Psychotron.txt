[Instrumental Intro]

Psychotron

Assassin in stealth, assailant from Hell
Impervious to damage

Computer on-board, engaged in a war
Non-stop combatant

Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron

Burning inside, godspeed in glide
Battle plan running

A killing machine, just downright mean
And forever cunning

Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron

[Guitar Solo]

Target to destroy, arms in employ
Full assault fire threat

Sensors indicate you will terminate
Life systems disconnect

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
