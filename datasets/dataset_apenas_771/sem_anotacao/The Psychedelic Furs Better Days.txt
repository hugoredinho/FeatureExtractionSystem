People call to say hello
They call to talk about the weather
All the places i don't go
They call to talk to me
They've got names without a face
And they've got faces i don't see
From the corners of my mouth
I hear your voice come falling down
From the corners of my mouth
Can't hear myself at all
All my senses in a know
It gets too dark in here
That i can't move
And i can't feel to touch
And there's you standing in my clothes
A perfect picture with you on my side
I never let it show
From the corners of my mouth
I hear your voice come falling down
From the corners of my mouth
Can't hear myself at all
I can't seem to find my feet
My body's shaking and
My tongue can't move
I turn my head to speak
I hear you call my name
I hear you calling me
On better days
On better days
From the corners of my mouth
I hear your voice come falling down
From the corners of my mouth
Can't hear myself at all
From the corners of my mouth
I hear your vioce come falling down
From the corners of my mouth
Can't hear myself at all
