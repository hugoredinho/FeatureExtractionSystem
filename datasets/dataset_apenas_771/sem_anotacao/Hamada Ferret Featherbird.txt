Time has come between us:
In the passing months I've felt you slip away
As your words and mine came like nursery rhymes
Till there was nothing left to say

Distance came between us long ago
As our memories faded away...
Over the miles I ceased to smile
Because nothing felt the same

That's how it seemed a week ago
Far off in time and space

Time and distance are between us now
They form a bond to make things sure
Nothing ever shatters
You know what happens:
Time and distance make a love secure
