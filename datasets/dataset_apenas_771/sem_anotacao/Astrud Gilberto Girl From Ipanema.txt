Olha que coisa mais linda
Mais cheia de graça
É ela a menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do céu de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead not at me

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que, quando ela passa
O mundo inteirinho se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo, but she doesn't see
But she doesn't see

Ah, but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead not at me

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que, quando ela passa
O mundo inteirinho se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo, but she doesn't see
But she doesn't see

But she doesn't see
He doesn't see
But she doesn't see
He doesn't see
But she doesn't see
But she doesn't see
No She doesn't see
