It's all over
Didn't even cry
I just stoped living
When you said goodbye

It's all over
Didn't feel a thing
I just stopped living;
Couldn't stand the pain

Hair of gold like leaves in September
Lips as fresh as spring
Love that warms like summer sun
Shouldn't die when winter comes

It's all over
Didn't even cry
I just stopped living
When you said goodbye
It's all over (it's all over)
