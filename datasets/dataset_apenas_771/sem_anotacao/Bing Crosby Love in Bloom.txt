Blue nights and you
Alone with me
My heart has never known such ecstasy
Am I on earth?
Am I in Heaven?
Can it be the trees
That fill the breeze
With rare and magic perfume?
Oh no, it isn't the trees
It's love in bloom
Can it be the spring
That seems to bring
The stars right into this room
Oh no, it isn't the spring
Its love in bloom
My heart was a desert
You planted a seed
And this is the flower
This hour of sweet fullfillment
Is it all a dream, a joy supreme
That came to us in the gloom?
You know it isn't a dream
It's love in bloom
My heart was a desert
But you planted a seed
And this is the flower
This hour of sweet fullfillment
Is it all a dream, a joy supreme
That came to us in the gloom?
You know it isn't a dream
It's love in bloom
