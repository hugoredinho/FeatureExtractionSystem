I tell myself his mem'ry doesn't hold me
But there's a picture of the man I say I'm over
By my bed, face down my bed

I'm so glad that broken heart's behind me
And I no longer let his love confine me
Now I'm free, this prisoner's finally free

But I don't need flowers, sweet talk
To fill wee hours of the night, now I'm alright
I lay down each night and turn out the light
And tell myself that I'm not lonely
With tears rollin' down my face, I'll lie myself to sleep

The girls down at the office think I'm so strong
And though my heart is breakin' I'm not lettin' on
What's inside, oh, I keep it all inside

A delivery boy brings in a dozen roses
And as I watch some lucky girl unfold them
I walk away, in tears I walk away

But I don't need flowers, sweet talk
To fill wee hours of the night, now I'm alright
I lay down each night and turn out the light
And tell myself that I'm not lonely
With tears rollin' down my face, I'll lie myself to sleep
I'll lie myself to sleep, ooh, I'll lie myself to sleep
