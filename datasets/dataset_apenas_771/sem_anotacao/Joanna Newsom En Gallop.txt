This place is damp and ghostly
I am already gone
And the halls were lined with the disembodied
And dustly wings, which fell from flesh
Gasplessly
And I go where the trees go
And I walk from a higher education
For now and for hire
It beats me, but I do not know
And it beats me but I do not know
It beats me, but I do not know
I do not know
Palaces and storm clouds
The rough, straggly sage
And the smoke
And the way it will all come together
In quietness and in time
And you laws of property
Oh, you free economy
And you unending afterthoughts
You could've told me before
Never get so attached to a poem
You forget truth that lacks lyricism
Never draw so close to the heat
That you forget that you must eat, oh...
