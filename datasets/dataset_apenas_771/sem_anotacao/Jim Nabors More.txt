More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I'll give to you alone
More than the simple words I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life will be in your keeping
Waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping
Longer than always is a long long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I never lived before
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more
Longer than always is a long long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I never lived before
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more....
