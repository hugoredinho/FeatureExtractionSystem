I can't believe the things I've seen
I wonder bout some things I've heard
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word

A bad enough situation
Is sure enough getting worse
Everybody's crying justice
Just as long as there's business first

Toe to toe, touch and go
Give a cheer, get your souvenir

People running round in circles
Don't know what they're headed for
Everybody's crying peace on earth
Just as soon as we win this war

Straight ahead, knock 'em dead
Pack your kid, choose your hypocrite

Well, you don't have to go to off-Broadway
To see something played absurd
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word

Nobody knows the meaning of the word
When they don't know the meaning of the word
Nobody knows the meaning of the word
Nobody knows the meaning of the word
