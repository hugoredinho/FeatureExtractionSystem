Today I made a point to go somewhere I knew you'd be
I had to know if you still had the same affect on me
And the moment that I saw you there, I knew

No matter what I do, I'm still not over you
I'm still not over you that feeling's still the same
I'm still not over you, I find that nothing's changed

And perhaps some day I'll find somebody new
But now it's much too soon, I'm still not over you

Today I made a point to go somewhere I knew you'd be
I had to know if you still had the same affect on me
And the moment at that I saw you there, I knew

No matter what, I'm still not over you
I'm still not over you that feeling's still all the same
I'm still not over you, I find that nothing's changed

And perhaps some day I'll find somebody new
But now it's much too soon, I'm still not over you
No matter what, I'm still not over you
