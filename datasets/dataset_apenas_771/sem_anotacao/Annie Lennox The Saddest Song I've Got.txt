Darling are your feeling
The same thing that I'm seeing?
The troubles of the day
Took my breath away
Took my breath away
Now you're no longer talking
And I'm no longing hearing
There's nothing left to say
Said it anyway
Said it anyway
And I want you not
I need you not
I'm dying 'cause this is the saddest song I've got
The saddest song I've got
Darling are you healing
From all those scars appearing?
And don't it hurt a lot?
Don't know how to stop
Don't know how it stops
Now there's no sense in seeing
The colors of the morning
Can't hold the clouds at bay
Chase them all away
Chase them all away
And I'm frozen still
Unspoken still
Hearts broken
Remembering something I forgot
Something I forgot
