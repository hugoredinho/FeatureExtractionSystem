So here we are we're standing face to face
And yet we seem to be a million miles apart
This world can feel like such a lonely place
It all depends on what you see from where you are
So please, please tell me what you can
'Cause I want to understand

How does it look from your side
How does it look from where you are
How does it look from your side
From your side of the world

So tell me the color of your sky above
Paint me a picture of the things that make you smile
Show me your fears and what you've dreaming of
Take me to where my heart can see across the miles
And please, please tell me what you can
'Cause I want to understand

How does it look from your side
How does it look from where you are
How does it look from your side
From your side of the world

Don't be surprised to find that I'm not too far away
'Cause what we are both in search of is one and the same
So please, please tell me what you see
'Cause I really want to be the one who understands
