I'm just saying I want my mummy back
Lost her to the drink but her soul's intact
Mama said to me be proud of who you are
She saw Jesus in the eyes of a broken man
Sail away, I am learning my lesson
Mama sends her love and Godspeed you come home
One little white lie was enough to conceal my goodbye
Then I stole away
Kissed her farewell and wished her the best for her life
Then I stole away like a thief in the night
I'm just saying not behind daddy's back
He takes care of her in his overtime
He's no saint I know as he goes around the town
Watch him cry himself to sleep, he's my daddy
Sail away, I will go it alone now
Leave my past behind to seek fortune and fame
Sail away, there's a storm in a teacup
Mama sends her love and Godspeed you come home
One little white lie was enough to conceal my goodbye
Then I stole away
Kissed her farewell and wished her the best for her life
Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night
One little white lie was enough to conceal my goodbye
Then I stole away
Like a prodigal son and wished her the best for her life
Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night
