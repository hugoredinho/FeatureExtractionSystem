[Instrumental Introduction]
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As You walk, you will walk close to me
When my feeble life is o'er
And time for me shall be no more
Gently lead me to that shore
Let me walk, let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
