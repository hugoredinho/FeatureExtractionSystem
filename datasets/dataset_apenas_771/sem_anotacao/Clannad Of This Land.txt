How gentle was the breeze that surrounded the way
How loud the sea's roar on the four winds everyday
Sharing love, wounded gifts from ancient long ago
Together they closed in the circles we know

Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes?
Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love
Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand?
Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this land
(2x)

How soulful those words that confuses the way
How wild the mountains' stare as they guard our every day
Take for granted noble hearts in the golden age that's flown
Between us, recall on a strong road we've known

Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes?
Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love
Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand?
Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this land
