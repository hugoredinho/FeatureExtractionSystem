My latest sun is sinking fast
My race has nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph is begun

O come, angel band, come and around me stand
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home

O bear my longing heart to Him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory

O come, angel band, come and around me stand
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
