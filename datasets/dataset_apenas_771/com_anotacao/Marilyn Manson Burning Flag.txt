[Verse 1]
They want to sell it out, buy it up, dumb it down
A good god is hard to find
I'll join the crowd that wants to see me dead
Right now, I feel I belong for the first time

[Pre-Chorus]
Multiply your death, divide by sex
Add up the violence and what do you get?

[Chorus]
We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

[Interlude]
You can point your gun at me
And hope it will go away
If God was alive
He would hate you, anyway

[Verse 2]
My right wing is flapping, 
the left one is grey
Let's hear it for the kids but nothing they say
They gyrate and G-rate on Election Day
We got our ABC's and our F-U-C-K
F-U-C-K, F-U-C-K

[Pre-Chorus]
Multiply your death, divide by sex
Add up the violence and what do you get?

[Chorus]
We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

[Interlude]
You can point your gun at me
And hope it will go away
If God was alive
He would hate you, anyway

[Chorus]
We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

[Outro]
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
