[Verse 1]
There is a blood red circle
On the cold dark ground
And the rain is falling down
The church door's thrown open
I can hear the organ's song
But the congregation's gone

[Chorus 1]
My city of ruins
My city of ruins

[Verse 2]
Now the sweet bells of mercy
Drift through the evening trees
Young men on the corner
Like scattered leaves
The boarded up windows
The empty streets
While my brother's down on his knees

[Chorus 1]
My city of ruins
My city of ruins

[Chorus 2]
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!

[Verse 3]
Now's there's tears on the pillow
And you took my heart when you left
Without your sweet kiss
My soul is lost, my friend
Tell me how do I begin again?

[Chorus 1]
My city of ruins
My city of ruins

[Bridge]
Now with these hands
Now with these hands
Now with these hands
I pray Lord
With these hands
With these hands
I pray for the strength, Lord
With these hands
With these hands
I pray for the faith, Lord
We pray for your love, Lord
We pray for the lost, Lord
We pray for this world, Lord
We pray for the strength, Lord
We pray for the strength, Lord

[Chorus 2]
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!
