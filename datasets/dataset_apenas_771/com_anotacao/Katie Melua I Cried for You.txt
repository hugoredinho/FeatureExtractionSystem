[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You're beautiful so silently
It lies beneath a shade of blue
It struck me so violently
When I looked at you
But others pass, they never pause
To feel that magic in your hand
To me, you're like a wild rose
They never understand why

[Chorus']
I cried for you and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you
, 
though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper

[Verse 2]
I'll cross the sea
For a different world
With your treasure, a secret
For me to hold
In many years, they may forget
This love of ours or that we met
They may not know how much you meant
To me

[Chorus]
I cried for you and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you, though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper

[Bridge]
Without you, now I see
How fragile the world can be
And I know you've gone away
But in my heart, you'll always stay

[Chorus]
I cried for you and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you, though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper

[Coda]
That beauty need only be a whisper
