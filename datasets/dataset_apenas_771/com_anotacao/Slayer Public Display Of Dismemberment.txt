[Verse 1]
Anarchy, disarray this is the world today
Justice is a lie for the followers to get by
No peace, only guns, can't trust anyone
Live or die it's an eye for an eye

[Chorus]
Unrest, martial law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment

[Verse 2]
Blameless innocent, lies of the decadent
Brazen hypocrites answering to idiots
New tax, market crash, high life never lasts
No quick fix, for broken politics

[Chorus]
Unrest, martial law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment

[Lead: Hanneman]

[Bridge]
Aftermath of tolerance judgment is defined
Individual pain is a strong incentive
Infiltrate with fear keeping penance ever near
Punish with indecency and mutilate for all to see

[Lead: King]

[Verse 3]
Disarray, no quick fix, for broken politics
Anarchy, live or die it's an eye for an eye

[Chorus]
Unrest, martial law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment
