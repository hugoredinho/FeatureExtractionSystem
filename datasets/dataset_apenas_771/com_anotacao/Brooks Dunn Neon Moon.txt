[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
And the whole world turns
Blue
There's a rundown bar
'Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

[Chorus]
Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 2]
I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
Oh if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 3]
The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
And the words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Outro]
Come watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Oh, watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
