[Verse 1]
Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same (The same)
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name

[Interlude]
I'm in a trance
I'm in a trance

[Verse 2]
Cosmic systems intertwine
Astral bodies drip like wine
All of nature ebbs and flows
Comets shoot across the sky
Can't explain the reasons why
This is how creation goes

[Verse 3]
I don't want nobody else ('Body else)
All the others look the same (The same)
Galaxies are sliding into view
I don't even know your name

[Chorus]
I'm in a trance
And the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

I'm in a trance
And the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

[Interlude]
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me

[Bridge]
I like to singy, singy, singy
Like a bird on a wingy, wingy, wingy
I like to rhumba, rhumba, rhumba
Dance to a samba, samba, samba

[Chorus]
I'm in a trance
And the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

I'm in a trance
And the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

[Outro]
Trance
I'm in a trance
Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name
