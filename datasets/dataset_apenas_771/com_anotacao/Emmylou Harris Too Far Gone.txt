[Verse 1]
I know that somewhere
There's someone you love more than me
Someone you love more than me
And I hate to say it
But you have a right to be free
I know that's the way it should be

[Chorus]
But I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
And I'm too far gone

[Verse 2]
If ever your new love
Should hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Just remember your old love
Will still be around loving you
I'll be around loving you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
And I'm too far gone
