[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing

[Chorus]
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)

[Chorus]
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

[Outro]
Play
I think it's love
I feel for you, I think it's love
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think it's love
Play
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you
