[Verse 1: Jerry Cantrell]
Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother, try and hope to find

[Chorus: Jerry Cantrell & Ann Wilson]
You were always so far away
I know that pain, so don't you run away
Like you used to do

[Verse 2: Jerry Cantrell]
Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

[Chorus: Jerry Cantrell & Ann Wilson]
You were always so far away
I know that pain, I won't run away
Like I used to do

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Jerry Cantrell]
Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

[Chorus: Jerry Cantrell & Ann Wilson]
You were always so far away
I know the way, so don't you run away
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
