[Verse 1]
Kiss and kill me sweetly
Come and drive me home
Drag the miles in me
I am yours alone

[Chorus]
Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into you

[Verse 2]
Desire me so deeply
Drain and kick me hard
Whisper secrets for me
Try to go too far

[Chorus]
Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into…

[Bridge]
Please, don’t change
Please, don’t change at all
Bring your rain
Bring your rain to fall

[Chorus]
Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into you

[Outro]
Come and kiss me sweetly
(Kiss kiss)
Ride the telephone
(Kiss kiss)
Drag the miles to me
(Kiss kiss)
I am yours alone
(Kiss kiss)
Yours alone
Yours alone
On the telephone
Yours alone
Looking for a kiss, kiss
Yours alone
