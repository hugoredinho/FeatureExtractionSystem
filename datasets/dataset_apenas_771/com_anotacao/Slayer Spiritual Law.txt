[Verse 1]
It's time to be born again
Don't talk about sex that's a sin
Confess your evils to the man
He'll do everything he can
Don't go mass you'll go to hell
We'll all be there it'll be swell

Pulling your lives
With such lies
Weak don't survive

[Verse 2]
We're being sucked up
Into the vacuum culture
This way this way
It's too late
Your addicted
Come on control yourself
Snatch that bottle off the shelve
You're trapped now with spiritual law
Spiritual law

[Verse 3]
Fiddle with your rosaries
Holy water only makes me bleed
Touch that cross to my head
It may burn but I won't be dead

To burn your rosaries
To burn it all
Death to us all

[Pre-Chorus]
It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late, you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside Daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

[Chorus]
Your hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it
There's one chance left
Get on your knees drink the wine
Chew the wafer

[Bridge]
People screaming can I be dreaming
Is this the truth I can't tell
Whether this is heaven or hell
Wolfbane and the sound of a silver bell

The air is thick
The smell of death is everywhere
It's all around
But I won't submit to death
You can go with the

[Verse 4]
Man don't lie why do they cry
Man don't lie why do they cry
Man don't lie why do they cry

Ruling your lives
With such lies
Weak won't survive

[Pre-Chorus]
It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

[Chorus]
You're hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it

It's not too late
It's not too late

[Outro]
Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today
Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today

Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today
Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today
