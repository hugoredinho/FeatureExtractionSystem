[Verse 1]
Operator, please connect me with 1982
I need to make apologies for what i didn't do
I sure do need to tell her that i've thought the whole thing through
And now it's clear that she is what i should have held on to

[Chorus]
They say hindsight's twenty-twenty
But i'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
It's that same ole lost love story
It's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982

[Verse 2]
Postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her now i know how long my love will last

[Chorus]
They say hindsight's twenty-twenty
But i'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
It's that same ole lost love story
It's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982

Losin' my mind, goin' back in time to 1982
