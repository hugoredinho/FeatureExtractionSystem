[Verse 1]
I got seven pictures of Buddha
The prophet's on my tongue
Eleven angels of mercy
Sighing over that black hole in the sun
My heart's dark but it's rising
I'm pulling all the faith I can see
From that black hole on the horizon
I hear your voice calling me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

[Chorus]
Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party
Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party
Tell me how do we get this thing started?
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place

[Verse 2]
Familiar faces around me
Laughter fills the air
Your loving grace surrounds me
Everybody's here
Furniture's out on the front porch
Music's up loud
I dream of you in my arms
I lose myself in the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

[Chorus]
Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party
Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party
Tell me, how do you live broken-hearted?
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place

[Bridge]
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place

[Verse 3]
I got a picture of you in my locket
I keep it close to my heart
This light shining in my breast
Leading me through the dark
Seven days, seven candles
In my window, light your way
Your favorite record's on the turntable
I drop the needle and pray
Band's counting out midnight
Floor's rumbling loud
Singer's calling up daylight
And waiting for that shout from the crowd
Waiting for that shout from the crowd[x5]

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Chorus]
Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party
Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party
Tell me how do we get this thing started?
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place
Meet me at Mary's place
Oh, meet me at Mary's place
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
