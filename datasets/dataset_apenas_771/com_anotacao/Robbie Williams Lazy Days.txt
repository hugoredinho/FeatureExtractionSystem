[Verse 1]
Lazy days calling to you
Come out to play
The future lies with you
Now you can be sure love is the cure
What we're searching for
Is to have a jolly good time
Crazy days but you'll get me through
And here I'll stay holding on to you
Now you can be sure
Our thoughts unpure
Will unlock the door
And we will have a jolly good time

[Chorus]
It can happen in any season
We don't need any reason
To sit around and wait
The world can change in a second so
I find the sunshine beckons me
To open up the gate
And dream and dream

[Verse 2]
Lazy days don't let them get you down
Wear your smile
I don't want to see you frown
Don't let them get you down

[Chorus]
It can happen in any season
We don't need any reason
To sit around and wait
The world can change in a second so
I find the sunshine beckons me
To open up the gate
And dream and dream

[Outro]
Then we will have a jolly good time, time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
