[Verse 1]
I've been down so long
I've been hurt for so long
There were times I thought I'd never so the break of day
It was hard for me to see your plan for me
And I tried to believe surely it won't last always

[Prehook 1]
But night after night
Night after night
Night after night
I pray Lord, don't take Your joy from me
Then late one night I read in Your love letter that it's gonna get better

[Hook]
Don't you know that
I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

[Verse 2]
When my enemies, tried to come for me
And they thought that my world was coming to an end
All the while You knew
That I would make it through
I feel closer to You now than I was when I first began

[Prehook 2]
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
You are my sunlight after the rain
Wherever You are
I just wanna be near You
I'm so glad I can hear You

[Hook]
Don't You know that
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

Don't You know that
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

[Vamp]

[Hook]
Don't You know that

I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You
