[Verse 1]
Met ‘em in a hotel, met ‘em in a hotel
Beneath ground
Tell me that he’s missing, tell me this is one for
Lollipop Gestapo

[Pre-Chorus]
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?

[Chorus]
Give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me more

[Post-Chorus]
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash

[Verse 2]
Met ‘em in a hotel, met ‘em in a hotel
You say he’s the biggest thing there’ll be this year
I guess that what I’m seeking
I guess that what I’m seeking isn’t here
Met him in a hotel, met him in a guess world
Guessed anyone but you

[Pre-Chorus]
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now

[Chorus]
Give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me...
Can't you just give me more, give me more, give me more

[Post-Chorus]
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash

[Bridge]
Where are the velvets, where?
Where are the velvets when you’re coming, coming down?
Where are the velvets, where?
Where are the velvets, when you’re coming, coming down?

[Pre-Chorus]
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild

[Outro]
King Solomon’s Mines,
 Exit 75
I’m still alive, I’m still alive
I’m still alive, I’m still alive
I’m still alive
