[Chorus:]
Look at us
After all these years together
Look at us
After all that we've been through
Look at us
Still leaning on each other

[Verse 1:]
If you want to see
How true love should be
Then just look at us
Look at you
Still pretty as a picture
Look at me
Still crazy over you
Look at us
Still believin' in forever

[Chorus]
Look at us
After all these years together
Look at us
After all that we've been through
Look at us
Still leaning on each other

[Verse 2:]
In a hundred years from now
I know without a doubt
They'll all look back and wonder how
We made it all work out
Chances are
We'll go down in history
When they want to see
How true love should be
They'll just look at us
