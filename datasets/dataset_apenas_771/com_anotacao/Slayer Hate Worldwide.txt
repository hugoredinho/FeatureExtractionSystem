[Verse 1]
I stab you right between the eyes
You awaken from the lies
I said it ever since the inception
Where the masters of deception
I'm a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

[Chorus]
My scars insane
My life profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide!

[Verse 2]
Like a storm that devastates
Religious doubt I instigate
Take a listen to my confession
There is no filter on my aggression
With a blister open wide
To keep the massacre alive
I got cold devastation
With my moral imperfection

[Chorus]
My scars insane
My life profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide!

[Verse 3]
Religious death, I instigate
From what the bible demonstrates
Does it document creation
Of this hopeless infliction
Of a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

[Chorus]
My scars insane
My life profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide!

[Outro]
Open life scars, crushing open wounds
The walls of this scene will be crashing at you
You left senseless mentally unfit
Never fucking heard from you again
Never fucking heard from again
