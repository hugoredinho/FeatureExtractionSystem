[Chorus]
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

[Verse 1]
You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny

[Pre-Chorus 1]
As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see

[Chorus]
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

[Verse 2]
Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head

[Pre-Chorus 2]
On your trail, I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Flesh is all I need

[Bridge]
I'll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon your chest
Safety out of reach

[Verse 1]
You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny

[Chorus]
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
There's only one way out of here
Piece by piece
