[Intro]
Nine!

[Verse 1]
From Liverpool to Tokyo
What a way to go
From distant lands one woman, one man
Let the four winds blow

[Chorus]
Three thousand miles over the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of the rising sun

[Bridge]
Love has opened up my eyes
Love has blown right through
Wherever you are, you are here
Wherever you are, you are here

[Chorus]
Three thousand miles over the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of surprising sun

[Verse 2]
Well now east is east and west is west
The twain shall meet
East is west and west is east
Let it be complete

[Chorus]
Three thousand miles over the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of the morning star
