[Opening sounds]

[Verse 1]
Black is the night, metal we fight
Power amps set to explode
Energy screams, magic and dreams
Satan records their first note
We chime the bell, chaos and hell
Metal for maniacs pure
Faster than steel, fortune on wheels
Brain hemorrhage is the cure

[Chorus]
For black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Lay down your souls to the gods rock n' roll

[Verse 2]
Freaking so wild, nobody's mild
Giving it all that you got
Wild is so right, metal tonight
Faster than over the top
Open the door, enter hell's door
Black is the code for tonight
Atomic force, feel no remorse
Crank up the amps now it's night

[Chorus]
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Lay down your soul to the gods rock n' roll

[Verse 3]
Metal ten fold through the deadly black hole
Riding hell's stallions bareback and free
Taking our chances with raw energy
Come ride the night with us, rock hard and fight
United my legions we stand
Freak hard and wild for us, give up your souls
Live for the quest Satan's band, let's go!

[Verse 4]
Against these odds, black metal gods
Fight to achieve our goal
Casting a spell, leather and hell
Black metal gods rock n' roll
Building up steam, nuclear screams
War-heads are ready to fight
Black leather hounds, faster than sound
Metal our purpose in life

[Chorus]
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Lay down your souls to the gods rock n' roll
Black metal
