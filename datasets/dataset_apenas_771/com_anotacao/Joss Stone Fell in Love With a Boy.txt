[Chorus]
Fell in love with a boy
I fell in love once and almost completely
He's in love with the world
And sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
He turns and says, "Are you alright?"
Oh, I must be fine cause my heart's still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Sarah says it's cool, she don't consider it cheating

[Verse 1]
Red hair with a curl
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes were peepin'
Can't keep away from the boy
The two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
Can't think of anything to do
My left brain knows all of love is fleeting
He's just lookin' for somethin' new
I said it once before but it bears repeating

[Verse 2]
Can't think of anything to do
My left brain knows all of love is fleeting
He's just lookin' for somethin' new
I said it once before but it bears repeating

[Chorus]
Fell in love with a boy
I fell in love once and almost completely
He's in love with the world and sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
He turns and says, "Are you alright?"
Oh, I must be fine cause my heart's still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Sarah says it's cool, she don't consider it cheating, oh

[Bridge]
Don't go telling no more
Don't go telling no more
Don't go telling no more lies on Sarah
Don't go telling no more
Don't go telling no more
Don't go telling no more lies on Sarah

[Verse 3]
Can't think of anything to do
My left brain knows all of love is fleeting
He's just looking for something new
I said it once before but it bears repeating

[Outro]
Gonna tell you what's on my mind
I'm gonna tell you what's on my mind
Cause it bears repeating
