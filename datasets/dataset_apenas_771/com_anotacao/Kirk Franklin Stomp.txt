[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
For those of you that think gospel music has gone too far
You think we got too radical with our message
Well I got news for you , you ain't heard nothin yet
And if you don't know now you know. Glory, Glory!!

[Verse]
Lately I've been going through some things that really got me down
I need someone somebody to help me come and turn my life around
I can't explain, I can't obtain it. Jesus your love is so, it's so amazing
It gets me high up to the sky, and when I think about your goodness it makes me wanna stomp

[Chorus]
Makes me clap my hands. Makes me wanna dance and stomp
My brother can't you see I got the victory. STOMP!!!

[Rapped Verse: Salt of Salt-N-Pepa]
When I think about the goodness and fullness of God
Makes me thankful pity the hateful I'm grateful
The Lord brought me through this far
Trying to be cute when I praise him raise him high
I keep the live beat bumping. Keep it jumping make the Lord feel something
Ain't no shame in my game God's Property. Kickin' it wit Kirk ain't no stoppin' me
UH stomp

[Bridge]
GP are you wit me?
Oh yeah we having church we ain't going nowhere
[repeat 3 times ]

Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp

I promise the stomp, the whole stomp, nothin but the stomp

It ain't over. It ain't over

Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp

GP are you wit me?
Oh yeah we having church we ain't going nowhere
