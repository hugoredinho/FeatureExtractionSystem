But I been thinkin' of you, the whole time through
The thought of your love got me excited
And now that all the waitin' is done
It's time to have some fun, my baby

Baby, I want you so
I wanna love you head to toe
I can't wait, no, I can't wait no longer
Come on baby, let's do this
You were my lover and my friend
I wanna love you 'til the end
To the very end, girl
I can't wait, no, I can't wait no longer
So come on girl, let's do this, yeah
