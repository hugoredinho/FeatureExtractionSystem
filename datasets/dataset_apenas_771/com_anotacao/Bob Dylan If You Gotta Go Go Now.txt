[Intro]
Listen to me, baby
There’s something you must see
I want to be with you, gal
If you want to be with me

[Chorus]
But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night

[Verse 1]
It am not that I’m questioning you
To take part in any quiz
It’s just that I have got no watch
And you keep asking me what time it is

[Chorus]
But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night

[Verse 2]
I am just a poor boy, baby
Looking to connect
But I certainly don’t want you thinking
That I have not got any respect

[Chorus]
But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night

[Verse 3]
You know I’d have nightmares
And a guilty conscience, too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do

[Chorus]
But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night

[Verse 4]
It ain't that I’m wanting
Anything you never gave before
It’s just that I’ll be sleeping soon
It’ll be too dark for you to find the door

[Chorus]
But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night
