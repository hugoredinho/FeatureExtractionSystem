Thunder Road
Oh baby, you were so right
Thunder Road
There's something dying down on the highway tonight

Thunder Road
Is for the lost lovers and all the fixed games
Thunder Road
For the tires rushing by in the rain
Thunder Road
Me and Billy we'd always sing
Thunder Road
We were gonna take it all and throw it all away
