Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh
