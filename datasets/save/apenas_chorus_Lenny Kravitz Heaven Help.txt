Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
Because I decided right now
I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)
I I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)

Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
Because I decided right now
I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)
Ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)

Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
Because I decided right now
I'm ready for love (I'm ready for love)
I'm ready for love
