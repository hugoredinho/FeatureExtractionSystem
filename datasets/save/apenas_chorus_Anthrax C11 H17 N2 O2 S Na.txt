Sodium pentathol was an idea I had
But what does the truth mean now
To all the  lost souls you've grabbed?
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it

Sodium pentathol
Still sounds great to me
An imitation of life buried in theology
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it
