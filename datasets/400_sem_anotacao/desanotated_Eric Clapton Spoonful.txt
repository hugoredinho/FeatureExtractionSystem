Could fill spoons full of diamonds
Could fill spoons full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything is fighting about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Could fill spoons full of coffee
Could fill spoons full of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is that enough for me?

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything is fighting about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Could fill spoons full of water
Save them from the desert sands
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything is fighting about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
