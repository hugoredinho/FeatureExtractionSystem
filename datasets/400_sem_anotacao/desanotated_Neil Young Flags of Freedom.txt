Today's the day our younger son
Is going off to war
Fighting in the age old battle
We've sometimes won before
Flags that line old main street
Are blowing in the wind
These must be the flags of freedom flying

Church bells are ringing
As the families stand and wave
Some of them are crying
But the soldiers look so brave
Looking straight ahead
Like they know just where they're going
Past the flags of freedom flyin'
Sister has her headphones on
She hears the music blasting
She sees her brother marchin' by
Their bond is everlasting
Listening to Bob Dylan singing in 1963
Watching the flags of freedom flying
She sees the president speaking
On a Flat-screen TV
In the window of the old appliance store
She turns to see her brother again
But he's already walking past
The flags of freedom flying
Have you seen the flags of freedom?
What color are they now?
Do you think that you believe in yours
More than they do theirs somehow?
When you see the flags of freedom flying
