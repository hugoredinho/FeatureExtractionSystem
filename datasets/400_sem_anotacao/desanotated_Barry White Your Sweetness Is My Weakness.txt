Your sweetness is my weakness and my weakness, girl, is you
Your sweetness is my weakness and my weakness, girl, is you
Sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness

Ooh, girl, you know like I know, uh-huh
What your lovin', girl, has done for me
Like a Mona Lisa hangin on a wall, uh-huh
You´re a lovely sight, lovely sight to see, mhm
The way you give me your sweet love
Any place and time
When you look at me I get weak in my knees
I´m so thankful that you're mine

Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah
Girl, your sweetness is my weakness, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness, well
Your sweetness is my weakness

They all think that I'm a fool, uh-huh
For lovin' you, for lovin' you this way
But sure as I am, I don't give a damn
About what the people, what the people say
Other girls try to imitate you
With the other boys, uh-huh
But I'm the only boy round here
Who's got the real McCoy

Your sweetness, girl, that's my weakness, uh-huh, uh-huh
Your sweetness, ooh, is my weakness, huh
Your sweetness, girl, is my weakness, ooh yeah

Your sweetness is my weakness and my weakness, girl, is you

Your sweetness is my weakness
Lord, your sweetness is my weakness
Lord, your sweetness, girl, is my weakness, mmm
Sweetness is my weakness, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Sweetness, weakness, yeah, oh oh oh oh yeah
My weakness your sweetness, yeah
Your sweetness is my weakness
Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Uh-huh), yeah (Uh-huh)
Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Ooh), yeah (Ooh)
Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
