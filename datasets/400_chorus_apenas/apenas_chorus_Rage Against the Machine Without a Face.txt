Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Yeah, born without a face
Without a face

Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves an the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Born without a face
