Fascination, stimulation
Stronger as I learn
By his hand, I understand
I was told to burn

Bastard son, your saving grace
Left alone I found my place
I find love in what I steal
You should have let me rest
In Potter's field
I was told to, I was told to

Fascination, stimulation
Stronger as I learn
By his hand, I understand
I was told to burn

Bastard son, your saving grace
Left alone I found my place
I find love in what I steal
You should have let me rest
In Potter's field
I was told to, I was told to
I was told to, I was told to
Stop it
