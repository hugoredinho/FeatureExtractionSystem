Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it
Your savior, my guillotine, crosses and kerosene

Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it
Your savior, my guillotine, crosses and kerosene

Shut down the devil sound
Check the heads bow in Vietnow
Shut down the devil sound
