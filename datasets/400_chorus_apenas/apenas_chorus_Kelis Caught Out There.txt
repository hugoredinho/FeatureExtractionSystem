What is this I see? (NO)
You don't come home to me (oh no)
When you don't come home to me (man)
Can't deal, can't bear
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I found her red coat and you're (bitch)
Caught out there!

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now

What is this I see (I don't believe this)
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies but to your surprise
Look, I hope you're happy since you're
Caught out there

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now

What is this I see

When you don't come home to me
Can't deal, can't bear (told you I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise

Caught out there

I hate you so much right now
