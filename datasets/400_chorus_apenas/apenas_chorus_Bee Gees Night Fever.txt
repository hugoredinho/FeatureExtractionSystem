And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
