Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange
, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange,
 
the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire
Yeah
