I'll never forget the joy in his face
He'd laugh and he'd cry and he'd ruin my place
He'd drive me crazy, and he'd drive me wild
I used to scream and shout

All day long

So don't tell me about politics
Or all the problems of our economics
When you can't look after what you can't own
You scream and shout

All day long
