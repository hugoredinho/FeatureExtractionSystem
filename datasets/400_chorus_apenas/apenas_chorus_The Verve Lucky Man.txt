But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

Well, I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

And how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

I hope you understand
I hope you understand
Oooooooh
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
Gotta love that'll never die
