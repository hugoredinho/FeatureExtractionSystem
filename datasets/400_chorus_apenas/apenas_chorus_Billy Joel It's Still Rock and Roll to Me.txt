Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
