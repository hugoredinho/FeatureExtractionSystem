You think your love's on solid ground
Then out of the blue, it all comes tumblin' down

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody help me understand

What's yours is yours, what's mine is mine
Is that all that's left, after all this time

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody...

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody help me understand
