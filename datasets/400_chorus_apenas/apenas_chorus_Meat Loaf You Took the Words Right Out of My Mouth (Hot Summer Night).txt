And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
And then you took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
And then you took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
