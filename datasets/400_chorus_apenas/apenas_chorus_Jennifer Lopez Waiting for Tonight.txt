Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh, oh)
Waiting for tonight, oh (Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh)
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
