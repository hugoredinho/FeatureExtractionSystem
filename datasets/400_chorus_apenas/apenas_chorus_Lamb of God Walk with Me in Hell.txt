We seek only reprieve and welcome the darkness
The myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten (forgotten)

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell

Now witness the end of an age
Hope dies in hands of believers
Who seek the truth in the liar's eye

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell
