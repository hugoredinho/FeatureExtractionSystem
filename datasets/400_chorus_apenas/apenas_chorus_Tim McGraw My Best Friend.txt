You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh oh
You're my best friend
