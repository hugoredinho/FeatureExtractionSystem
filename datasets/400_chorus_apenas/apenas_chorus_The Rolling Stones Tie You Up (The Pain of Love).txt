Why so divine, the pain of love?
You dream of it passionate
You get a rise from it

Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
That's what they call it: the pain of love
Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up
