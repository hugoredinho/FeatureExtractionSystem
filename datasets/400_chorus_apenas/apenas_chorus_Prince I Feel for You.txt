I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing

I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)

I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you
