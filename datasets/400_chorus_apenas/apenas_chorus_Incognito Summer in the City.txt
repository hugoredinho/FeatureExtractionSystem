But at night it's a different world
So nice just to be a girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And baby, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer
In the city, in the summer, in the city

But at night it's a different world
So nice just to be a girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And baby, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer
In the city, in the summer, in the city

But at night it's a different world
So nice just to be a girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And baby, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer
In the city, in the summer, in the city
