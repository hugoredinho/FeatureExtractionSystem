But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me

But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
Just one time
