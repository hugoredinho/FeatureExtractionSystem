And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can’t take this stuff no more

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
