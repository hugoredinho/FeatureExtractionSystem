Sodium pentathol was an idea I had
But what does the truth mean now
To all the  lost souls you've grabbed?
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it

You're in total control
And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up

Sodium pentathol
Still sounds great to me
An imitation of life buried in theology
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it

You're in total control
And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up
