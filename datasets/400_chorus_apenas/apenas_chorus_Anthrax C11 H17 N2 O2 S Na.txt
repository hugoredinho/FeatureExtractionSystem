I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that
Makes me smile is your pain
I don't even care
When did you treat anyone fair?
To say I'm not enjoying this
Would be insane

Sodium pentathol was an idea I had
But what does the truth mean now
To all the  lost souls you've grabbed?
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it

You're in total control
And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up

I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that
Makes me smile is your pain
If I ever had the chance
I'd kick out your chair
Just to watch you dance
Irrelevant, your vanity prevents change

Sodium pentathol
Still sounds great to me
An imitation of life buried in theology
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it

You're in total control
And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up
