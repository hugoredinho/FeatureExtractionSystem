Multiply your death, divide by sex
Add up the violence and what do you get?

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

Multiply your death, divide by sex
Add up the violence and what do you get?

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag
