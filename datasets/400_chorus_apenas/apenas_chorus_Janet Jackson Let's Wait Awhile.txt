Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
You know you can't rush love
Love
Let's wait awhile (Ooh, ooh)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Wait awhile)
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far (Far, far, oh)
Let's wait awhile (Let's just take our time)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Love's so good)
Sure our love will be there
Let's wait awhile (Slow it down)
Before we go too far
