I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
