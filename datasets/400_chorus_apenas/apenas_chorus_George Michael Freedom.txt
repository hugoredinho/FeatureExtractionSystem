I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around
