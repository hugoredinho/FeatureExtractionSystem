Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me?
Look what you did to me (Oh, baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(Made me cry)
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me

Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby, face to face (Mmm-mm)
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say, oh

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (All you did was lie to me, baby)
Look what you did to me (Can't believe what you did to me, yeah)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? (Why'd you do it?)
Can't take what you did to me
You didn't have to do it to me, baby

All I really wanted was some of your time (Oh, baby)
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (Ooh, all I really wanted, ahh)
Look what you did to me (It's all I really wanted, baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me
I wanted your love
All I really wanted was some of your time (All I really want)
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (Do me right, can't take it no more)
Look what you did to me (Why did you do me that way?)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Thought you'd do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(But you made me cry)
What'd you do to me? (Ohh-whoa-ohh-oh)
Can't take what you did to me
