Welcome to your nightmare
You just can't walk away
It's time for you to choose your fate
You just can't let it lay
Welcome to our nightmare
Your whole life's on the way, today

You're no good, misunderstood
A.I.R
All their hopes and visions
Of what they want you to be
Crucial times, made up minds
A.I.R
So high and mighty
Though much too blind to see
