It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late, you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside Daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

Your hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it
There's one chance left
Get on your knees drink the wine
Chew the wafer

It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

You're hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it
