My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The most beautiful angel
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness

Unpredictable, the prince of darkness
