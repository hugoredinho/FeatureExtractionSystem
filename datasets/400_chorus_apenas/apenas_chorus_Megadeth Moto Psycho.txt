Got my wheels in motion
And I got a path to beat
I hit the road to 'I don't know'
And look for 'tough shit street'

One way ticket nowhere
There's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed
But I'm going there again

Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a moto psycho
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
One hundred miles an hour
Moto psycho
I'm a moto psycho
Moto psycho

Got my wheels in motion
And I got a path to beat
I hit the road to 'I don't know'
And look for 'tough shit street'

One way ticket nowhere
There's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed
But I'm going there again

Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a moto psycho
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
One hundred miles an hour
Moto psycho, I'm a moto psycho

One way ticket nowhere
There's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed
But I'm going there again

Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a moto psycho
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto psycho
