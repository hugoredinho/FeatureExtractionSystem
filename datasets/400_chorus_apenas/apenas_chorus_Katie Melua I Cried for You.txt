I cried for you and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you
, 
though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper

I cried for you and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you, though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper

I cried for you and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you, though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper
