You can try but you'll never understand
This is something you will never understand
Can you hear it now?
Hear it coming now?
Can you hear it now?

On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our bones
Our skin
We will not let you in

On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood
Will stay
We will not go away
On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood
Our grace
Will never leave this place
