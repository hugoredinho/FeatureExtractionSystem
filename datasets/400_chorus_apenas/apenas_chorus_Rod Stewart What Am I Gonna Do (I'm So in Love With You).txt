Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

Something you've got is something I need right now
Let's not mess around anymore
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?
What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?
