This ain't about me
I'm better than you'll ever be
You don't concern me
I know you'll never get to me
You want a shot
I can take your best, bring it on
Get ready for the pain
Cause this where it's going down

War zone, war zone
This is where it's going down
War zone, war zone
When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way

This ain't about me
I'm better than you'll ever be
You don't concern me
You know you'll never get to me
You want a shot
I can take your best, bring it on
Get ready for the pain
Cause this is where it's going down

War zone, war zone
This is where it's going down
War zone, war zone
When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
