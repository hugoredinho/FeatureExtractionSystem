I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Oh if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
