Pray until your number, asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting, tomorrow's turned up dead

Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals

Pray now, baby
Pray your life was just a dream

Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals

Pray now, baby
Pray your life was just a dream
The world in my hands
There's no one left to hear you scream
There's no one left for you
