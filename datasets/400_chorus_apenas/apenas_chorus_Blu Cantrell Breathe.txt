All we do is make up
Then break up
Why don't we wake up
And see?
When love hurts
It won't work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe

All we do is make up
Then break up
Why don't we wake up
And see?
When love hurts
It won't work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
