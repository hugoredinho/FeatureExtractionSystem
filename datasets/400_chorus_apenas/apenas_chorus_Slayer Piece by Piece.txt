Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

On your trail, I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Flesh is all I need

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
There's only one way out of here
Piece by piece
