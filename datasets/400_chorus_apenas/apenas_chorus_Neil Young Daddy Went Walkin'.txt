My old dad went a walking one day
Pushing tall weeds
Right outta his way
My old dad went a walking one day

Hey now, hey now


Old man crossing the road
You've got to let him go
Old man crossing the road
He's feeling fine

Daddy went a riding in his old car
Took the dog with him
Cause it ain't too far
Daddy went riding in his old car
Hey now, hey now

Brown leather boots
And an old straw hat
Daddy's getting wood
With the barnyard cat
Got a little dirty
But that's all right
Hey now, hey now
