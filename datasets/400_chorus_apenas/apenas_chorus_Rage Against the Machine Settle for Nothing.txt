Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Death is on my side
Suicide

Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide
Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face
Yeah
