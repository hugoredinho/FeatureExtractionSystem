Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waitin' to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh
