Night grows cold, twilight's near
On the edge of madness, the wounds are sheared
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
Dead soul
Stone cold
Out into the night

Voices inside my head
Hold me under
Voices oppress
Like roaring thunder
An echo bouncing inside my brain
How much can I take of the pain
The pain

A war raging deep inside my head
A split decision that will end with me dead
You see the agony in my eyes
Protruding aimless
I think it's time to
Die
