Torn between two lovers on the jukebox
I'm thinking how I could have wrote that song
Wondering if God loves us when we're cheating
Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong
And I guess I should be signing "Rock of Ages"
"Amazing Grace" and some of those good songs
But my cheating heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong

Torn between two lovers just keeps playing
I don't want to be right if loving you is wrong
I'm wondering if God loves us when we're cheating
Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong?
And I guess I should be singing "Rock of Ages"
"Amazing Grace" and some of those good songs
But my cheating heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong

My cheating heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
