Hey now, hey now

Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right

Daddy went a riding in his old car
Took the dog with him
Cause it ain't too far
Daddy went riding in his old car
Hey now, hey now

Brown leather boots
And an old straw hat
Daddy's getting wood
With the barnyard cat
Got a little dirty
But that's all right
Hey now, hey now

Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right
