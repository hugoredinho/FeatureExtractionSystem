Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Trouble always seems to find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted head and me remain alone
Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I try to find a light to guide me home
Momma please just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
'Cause you're the only one that really knows

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of fate and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of timeI'm running out of time
Running out of time

Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's still afraid
