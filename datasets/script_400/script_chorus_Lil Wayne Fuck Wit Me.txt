It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' with me get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don't know me, I'll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now, them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
