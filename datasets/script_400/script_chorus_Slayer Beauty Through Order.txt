It's the feel of your blood
As it flows smoothly down my skin
Intoxicating my soul
Immortality, seducing me
Burning in your own hell
Which now binds you to me infinitely
Spirits of angels don't weep for you enticing me
Vanity, blood
Left for you to drink

Eternity waits for you
Vanity, blood
Left for you to drink
Eternity waits for you to drink

Vanity, blood
Left for you to drink
Eternity waits for you
Vanity blood
Left for you to drink
Eternity waits for you to drink

Creature from hell why can't you see the things I see?
Mirror tells me that you were always meant for me
You are my sacrifice
Blood is the deficit
Biting the flesh, face my sick prelude
Now meet your frozen death
God did not do this
God did not do this
God did not do this
God did not do this

Murder is my birthright
The bloodline proves aristocracy
Walled in, left for dead
Your actions show no hypocrisy
My birthright, is murder
My birthright, is murder
Birthright, murder
Birthright, murder
Birthright, murder
Birthright, murder
