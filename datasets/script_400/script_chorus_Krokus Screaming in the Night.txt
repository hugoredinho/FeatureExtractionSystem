Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love was true)
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ohuh-ohuh, oh-uhh-ohh

Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love was true)
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you, oh
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love)
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you, oh
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh
