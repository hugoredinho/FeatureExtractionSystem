Many's the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
Oh, but I'm alright, I'm alright
Just weary to my bones
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
So far away from home
So far away from home

And I dreamed I was dying
I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
Looking back down at me, smiled reassuredly
I dreamed I was flying
High up above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying
