When it's ice cream weather get the gang back together
Roll down your windows and ride
They'll be sleeping in the sand dunes dancing in the streets
They're just trying to keep the summer alive

They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Sum-sum-summer alive)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Ah keep the summer)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Sum-sum-summer alive)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Try to keep the summer)

When it's ice cream weather all the girls will look better
The boys try to give them a ride
To the one last party before the school bell rings
They're just trying to keep the summer alive

Keep the summer alive
(yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)
We'll just
(Yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)
Keep the summer alive
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)
Yeah trying to keep the summer alive
