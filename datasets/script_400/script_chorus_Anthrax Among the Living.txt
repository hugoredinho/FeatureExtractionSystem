He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with power
Among the living
Follow me or die

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with power
Among the living
Follow me or die

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die

Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!
