That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, was it all a lie
After all this time, that ain't no way to go

That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, now was it all a lie
After all this time...

That ain't no way to go, now girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, now was it all a lie
After all this time, that ain't no way to go
