Here I am, baby, oh oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am, baby, whoa-oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, ahh

You got my future in your hands, baby, yeah
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man
But here, I, ahh, with your future, got your future, baby, I, I
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Here I am, baby, ahh

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
