[Instrumental Intro]
An iron fist quietly sits
Inside the Velvet Glove
Take control, untouchable
Just like God above
I can't escape, wrapped in red tape
What will become of me?
If I object, then I defect
My country 'tis of thee
"The White House is calling."
Tell 'em I'll call them back
Just tell 'em anything
Yeah, get 'em off my back
(The world needs a hero)
Not that I would ever lie
But I have no choice
Words I say heard today
Are not mine, just my voice
"NATO is on line one."
They wanna talk to me?
Tell 'em that I'm not in
Tell 'em that I'm not free
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
Phantom rule, the hidden jewel
Who's really in control?
On puppet strings, a nation swings
Undermined by moles
"The UN is on hold."
Tell 'em I'll call 'em back
Yeah, tell 'em anything
Just get 'em off my back
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero

[Instrumental Break]
"Dave, the White House is calling."
They wanna talk to me?
Tell 'em that I can't be bought
Tell 'em that I'm not free
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
