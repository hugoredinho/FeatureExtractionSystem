"Anyway, this is Noise The Show, I'm Jimmy Summer. There's a really great show last night, down in d-downtown somewhere, um, the Beastie Boys played; they were great.  Reagan Youth played. They were great.  Bad Brains, great, great, great. Great show! Anyway, we're going to hear something  now from the Beastie Boys.  This one's called 'Egg Raid on Mojo.' They're one of New York's best."
