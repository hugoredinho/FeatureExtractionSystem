Tell you why I called on you
This is what we're gonna do
Take this lovely gift of love
Sent to us from Heaven above
I said baby, I think that we can help each other to see, oh yeah
We've made this life that we're living
Seem more like it's supposed to be
Well every man should have a good woman
Every woman should have a good man
Won't you stand along beside me
Let me do the best I can
Take each other's heart in hand
I want to sing just a little love song
I want to sing to you for a little while
Back up and toe the line for you
I want to be your all in all
I want to sing just a little love song
I want to sing to you for a little while
Back up and toe the line for you
I want to be your all in all
Bless you baby, I love you so
Love from whom all blessings flow
Me to you and you to me
This is how it's gonna be
I said baby we're gonna know the joy
The years can bring oh yes we will
And every time I think about it
I just want to lift my heart and sing, one more time
Oh every man should have a good woman
Every woman should have a good man
Won't you stand along beside me
Let me do the best I can
Take each other's heart in hand
I want to sing just a little love song
I want to sing to you for a little while
Back up and toe the line for you
I want to be your all in all
I want to sing just a little love song
I want to sing to you for a little while
Back up and toe the line for you
I want to be your all in all
I want to sing just a little love song
I want to sing to you for a little while
Back up and toe the line for you
I want to be your all in all
I want to sing just a little love song
I want to sing to you for a little while
Back up and toe the line for you
I want to be your all in all
In all, in all, in all
