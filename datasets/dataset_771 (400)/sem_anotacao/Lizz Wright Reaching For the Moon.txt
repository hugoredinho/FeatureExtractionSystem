The moon and you appear to be
So near and yet so far from me
And here am I on a night in June
Reaching for the moon and you
I wonder if we'll ever meet
My song of love is incomplete
I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you
I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you
