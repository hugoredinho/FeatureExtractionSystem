Another sunny afternoon
Tonight is the world
It look that sun might face
To make it through the years
And somehow took those boats in silly waves
It was another day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no
Should have held you till the storm went by
We had nothing left to hang on to
Too many words you say
Not the words connecting me to thy
Just another day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no
The two of us we both just let it fly
Didn't see it leave
Didn't do and try
I only knew that we were moving on
Suddenly it's gone
Never knowing why
Oh no
Oh no
Don't have a reason I can give
At least not one that I can understand
Just somehow disappeared
Slipped beneath the fingers of my hand
Was on a day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no
Had it once but we just let it fall
Should have held it close
Could have had it all
I'm thinking 'bout the life we could have made
Lost what we had
Somewhere along the way
Oh no
Oh no
A wake up call alone again
Half remembered dream inside my head
You took me through the day
Followed me at night into my bed
Another day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no

[Repeat]
