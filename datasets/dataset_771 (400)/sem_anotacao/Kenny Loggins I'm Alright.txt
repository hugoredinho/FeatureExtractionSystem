I'm alright
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be?

I'm alright
Don't nobody worry 'bout me
You got to gimme a fight
Why don't ya just let me be?

Do what you like
Doin' it naturally
But if it's too easy
They're gonna disagree

It's your life
Isn't it a mystery?
If it's nobody's business
It's everybody's game

Got to catch ya later
No now, cannonball it right away
Some Cinderella kid
Get it up and get you a job
(Dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip)

I'm alright
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be?

I'm alright
Don't nobody worry 'bout me
You got to gimme a fight
Why don't ya just let me be?

Who do you want?
Who you gonna be tonight?
Who is it really
Making up your mind?

You wanna listen to the man
Pay attention to the magistrate
And while I gotcha in the mood
Listen to your own heart beatin'
Own heart beatin'
Own heart beatin', own heart

Don't it get ya movin' m-m-m-m-man
It makes me feel good
Some Cinderella kid
Well, get it up and get you a job
(Dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip)
I'm (boom boom boom)

I'm alright
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be?
(Be the ball, be the ball)

I'm alright
Don't nobody worry 'bout me
You got to gimme a fight
Why don't ya just let me be?

I'm alright
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be?

I'm alright

I'm alright
Just let me be

I'm alright

I'm alright
Just let me be
Everybody let me be
