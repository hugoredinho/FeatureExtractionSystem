You'll never know just how much
I miss you
You'll never know just how much
I care
And if I tried
I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know
For haven't I told you so
A million or more times
You went away
And my heart went with you
I speak your name
In my every prayer
If there is some other way
To prove that I love you
I swear I dont know how
You'll never know if you dont know now
You'll never know if you dont know now
