Richard Raw - Marvin's Groove

Our living conditions are antithetic
Scold Jewish bankers they say I'm anti- Semetic
Deformation league seeking to censor my verses
Industry execs seeking to alter my purpose
Record labels got you on a slave block for purchase
They put you on a tour you a clown joining a circus
Martin Luther was peaceful Malcolm X was violent
But no matter the message they left them both silent
See the God of the prophets that's who I symbolize
While crime is a multibillion dollar enterprise
Career criminals are profitable to the system
Put some knowledge in your bars they no longer listen
And women except being called bitches and hoes
Being cast for a part but your missing your clothes
Strip naked let it twerk don't you say a word
Say your not a chicken head but your still a bird
Being served on a plate by the man's flunkie
Showing off your breast you a fix for the junkies
And I don't believe everything that I read
Like the fictitious story of your Adam and Eve
We predated your Bible Stories thousands of years
But your Bible stories gave us like thousands of fears
Fear of God your put it in us you have the nerve
Why should I fear the deity that I choose to serve
The Americans dreams become a nightmare
They never stick to their laws why should we fight fare
You say we came from monkeys but that's a damn lie
Since we believed it, is that the reason we can't try
Adel sings soul songs and she gets awards
While Jill Scott and Anthony Hamilton get ignored
They killed Neo Soul, they killed Conscious Rap
To prepare people for the invasion of Iraq
Things that make me feel sick
Like when Public Enemy kicked out Professor Griff
I yell Alhamduallah but I am not Islaamic
But no doubt i'll bust a shot for Khalid Muhammad
Who was murdered for being so unapologetic
With no conspiracy the CIA probably did it
The CIA killed Malcolm, King, and Bob Marley
Peter Tosh, Fred Hampton and Marcus Garvey
We just party and drink without a thought about it
Stop using the excuse you weren't taught about
Disrespecting the ones who really fought about it
We're in the same conditions that really brought about it
