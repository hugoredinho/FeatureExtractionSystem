We were made to love and be loved
But the price this world demands
Will cost you far too much
Spent so many lonely years just tryin' to fit in
Now I've found my place
In this circle of friends

In a circle of friends
We have one Father
In a circle of friends
We share this prayer
That every orphan soul will know
And all will enter in
To the shelter of this circle of friends

If you weep, I will weep with you
If you sing for joy the rest of us
Will lift our voices too
But no matter what you feel inside
There's no need to pretend
That's that way it is in this circle of friends

In a circle of friends
We have one Father
In a circle of friends
We share this prayer
That we'll gather together
No matter how the highway bends
I will not lose this circle of friends

Among the nations, tribes, and tounges
We have sisters and brothers
And when we meet in Heaven
We will recognize each other
With joy so deep (joy so deep)
And love so sweet (love so sweet)
We'll celebrate these friends
And life that never ends

In a circle of friends
We have one Father
In a circle of friends
We share this prayer
That it will not be long
Before all will enter in
To the shelter of this circle of friends

That it will not be long
Before all will enter in
To the shelter of this circle of friends

Circle of friends...
