Oh, let that jukebox keep on playin'
Let  that record roll around
Let  my baby keep on sayin'
She's a lonesome gal in town
Let her know that I'll be waitin'
When  my lonely days are through
Let  the jukebox keep on playin'
'Til I'm ho-holdin' you

Oh,  let those honkytonkin' angels
Be the girls I'll never loved
Let 'em know it's you I'm cravin'
It's you I'm dreamin' of
Let  'em know that I'll be waitin'
When my lonely days are through
Let the jukebox keep on playin'
'Til I'm ho-holdin' you

Oh, let that jukebox keep on playin'
Let that record roll around
Let my baby keep on sayin'
She's a lonesome gal in town
Let her know that I'll be waitin'
When my lonely days are through
Let the jukebox keep on playin'
'Til I'm ho-holdin' you
