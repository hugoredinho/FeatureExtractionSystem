[Verse 1]
Take a deep breath
'Cause it all starts now
When you pull the fuckin' pin
The shrapnel burns as it tears into the skin
Ever wonder what it takes to be questioning your faith?
This is what it's like when it happens every goddamn day
Violence is our way of life
Shards of life like confetti in the air
The flesh storm grows as it breeds despair
You hear screams in the distance fighting the resistance
Not cries of war
These are just the sounds of pain

[Chorus]
It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion

[Lead - Hanneman]

[Verse 2]
Killing's in style and it's now the main event
The cameras are whores for the daily bloodshed
Like a junkie, hungry for a fix of anything
The media devours and feasts upon the inhumane
Violence is our way of life
It's all too fuckin' clear we can never coincide
So let's all drink to genocide
All the venomous sights border on the arcane
In times of war, everything is bound by pain

[Chorus]
It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion

[Post-Chorus]
Warfare knows no compassion
Thrives with no evolution
Unstable minds exacerbate un-rest (in peace)

[Lead - King]

[Bridge]
There's no future, the world is dead
So save the last bullet for your head
Only fallen have won
Because the fallen can't run
My vision's not obscure
For war there is no cure
So hear the only law
Men killing men for someone else's cause

[Chorus]
It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion
