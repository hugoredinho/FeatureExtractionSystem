[Verse]
Deep inside this lonely prison where the pleasures are so few
Where the walls are strong and the days are long and there's nothing new
I learned to play the guitar and I'm a-doing the best I can
I guess I could be worse because I made the prison band
I made the prison band

[Verse]
Now there's old Bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, Willie on the steel guitar
He hails from Pocatello and he drags a pretty mean bar
And back on the drum, there's Two-Time Tom, our rimshot temple man
The boys call me their singing emcee since I made the prison band
I made the prison band

[Verse]
I've been planning a break since Christmas, I had the details all worked out
But now I know that I ain't gonna go and there's no doubt
I had my try-out Sunday and the outcome changed my plan
I got to rehearse for the Friday night show 'cause I made the prison band
I made the prison band

[Chorus]
There's old Bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, Willie on the steel guitar
He hails from Pocatello and he drags a pretty mean bar
And back on the drum, there's Two-Time Tom, our rimshot temple man
The boys call me their singing emcee since I made the prison band
I made the prison band
I made the prison band
