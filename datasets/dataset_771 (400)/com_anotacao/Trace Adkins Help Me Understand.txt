[Verse 1]
Once, in a lifetime
You'll open up your heart
Maybe once, in your lifetime
You'll swear to never be apart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You think your love's on solid ground
Then out of the blue, it all comes tumblin' down

[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody help me understand

[Verse 2]
And my picture, in your locket
What will you do with it now
All our friends, and all our memories
Tell me how we sort them out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What's yours is yours, what's mine is mine
Is that all that's left, after all this time

[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody...

[Bridge]
Help me understand
Why I'm not part of our plan
And you don't need me anymore
Help me understand
Why I still want to be where you are
Even though I know in my hear
You don't love me anymore

[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody help me understand
