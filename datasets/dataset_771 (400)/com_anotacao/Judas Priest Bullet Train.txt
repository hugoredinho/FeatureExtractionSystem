[Verse 1]
Sunrise showing every flaw
Paying for the nights before
Dark eyes, scanning every vein
Exploding cannot stand the strain
Standing on trial, scrutinize me
Questionize my strong denial

[Chorus]
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain

[Verse 2]
Windows, illuminating stains
Breakdown closing in again
Free fall as I close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Changing my course blurred and scorched
Breathing exhausts we distort
By gravity of such G-force

[Chorus]
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain

[Verse 3]
Breakdown close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Stained glass bursting in
Shattering my world again
Free fall never can
Ever reach the ground again
Dark eyes scanning in
Feel my mind explode within
Wanting much more implore you
Near to death's door to ignore
The screams of all
Who fall before

[Chorus]
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain

[Outro]
Bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, bullet, bullet
