[Verse 1]
Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Well I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

[Verse 2]
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

[Chorus]
Ho ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

[Verse 3]
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

[Chorus]
Ho ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

[Verse 3]
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
