[Chorus]
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
You're so lovable
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
You're so lovable

[Verse 1]
My baby gave me notice to quit
I just can't get used to it
She broke my little heart in two
Now somebody else is being the same old you

[Chorus]
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
You're so lovable

[Verse 2]
My long baby got Egyptian eyes
And a wicked look beyond compare
If you thought I was a fool for you
Then I must be a bigger fool for her

[Chorus]
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
You're so lovable

[Verse 3]
He'd turn the flowers of springtime into a wreath
He says he'll love you eternally
I say please please can't you keep it brief

[Bridge]
They say they're going to bury you because
You're so lovable
Put your money where your mouth was
You're so lovable
Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam
You're so lovable
The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom
You're so, you're so lovable
You're so lovable
You're so lovable
You're so lovable

[Verse 4]
You're so sweet, you're so honest
You say "I'll be true to you boy
But I won't promise"
Then you say you love me
Then you show me
As you lie there so lifelike below me

[Chorus]
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
It's going 'round the town
You're so lovable
You're so lovable
You're so lovable
