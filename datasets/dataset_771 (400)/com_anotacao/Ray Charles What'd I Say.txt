[Verse 1]
Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right now, hey hey, all right
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right now now now, hey hey, hey hey
Tell your mama, tell your pa
I'm gonna send you back to Arkansas
Oh yes, ma'am, you don't do right, don't do right

[Bridge]
When you see me in misery
Come on, baby, see about me
Now yeah, all right, all right, ah, play it, boy

She can do the Birdland all night long
