[Verse 1:][Vince]
If she only knew what I was thinking
If she only knew what was in head
Why can't she see my heart is breaking
She'd be mine if weren't for him
So many times I've dreamed I had her
I've called her name when I lay down
Still I can't learn to live without her
A jealous heart is all I've found

[Chorus:][Both]
I see your face but you're not next to me
And I won't take what you can't give to me
This lonely place is all I hope to find
If it weren't for him then you'd be mine

[Verse 2:][Rosanne]
If he only knew what I was thinking
If he only knew what was in my head
Why can't he see my heart is breaking
He'd be mine if it weren't for him

[Outro:][Vince]
You'd be mine if it weren't for him
