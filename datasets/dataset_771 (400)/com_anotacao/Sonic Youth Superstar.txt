[Intro]
Ah...
Ah...

[Verse 1]
Long ago
And oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar
It sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really there
It's just the radio

[Chorus]
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Loneliness
Is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again
What to say
To make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

[Chorus]
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
