[Verse 1]
Sons of vengeance, can you rescue me
They got me tied up to a woe tree
They had me screamin' and alone in the night
I'm beginning to see what's wrong and what is right
What is wrong and what is right, oh, ohoh-uh
What is wrong and what is right

[Verse 2]
The gates was gettin' rusty, as we sailed into the dark
The stars were out and shinin' against the moonlit hour
The wolves were out and howlin', most of the time
And I was cold and shiverin' and bleedin' in the night
Bleedin' in the night, oh, ohoh-uh
Bleedin' in the night

[Chorus]
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love was true)
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ohuh-ohuh, oh-uhh-ohh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
In the corner of the valley, we took him by surprise
The sound of steel rang loud, above the battle cries
I found her lying lifeless, dagger through her heart
I picked her up, and held her high, and I swore to be avenged
Swore to be avenged, ohuh-oh, swore to be avenged, oh

[Outro]
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love was true)
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you, oh
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love)
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you, oh
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh
