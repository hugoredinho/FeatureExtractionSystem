[Verse 1]
Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

[Verse 2]
A world full of shit coming down
Tribal violence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face

[Verse 3]
War of races
World without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

[Chorus]
We're born
With pain
No more
We're dead
Embryonic cells

[Bridge]
Corrosion inside - we feel
Condemned future - we see
Emptiness calls - we hear
Final premonition - the truth

[Verse 4]
Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

[Chorus]
We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're dead
