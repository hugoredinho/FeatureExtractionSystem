[Intro]
Ooh
Everywhere I look, I see rain...
Why am I here if you're there?
So far away, it's not fair
To be without you like this
I miss you more than you know
The nights are long, the days slow
Without the warmth of your kiss
Wish you were back here with me
'Cause out my window, all I see is

[Chorus]
Rain, rain in the sky
Everywhere I look my eyes see
Rain, rain fallin' down
Crying as it hits the ground
Rain, rain in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Rain, rain
Falling rain

[Verse 2]
The sun is strong when you're near
But when you're gone, it disappears
Behind an ocean of blue
The telephone's not good enough
It can't reach out it can't touch me
The way that you do
Wish you would knock at my door
'Cause only you can stop this pouring

[Chorus]
Rain, rain in the sky
Everywhere I look my eyes see
Rain, rain fallin' down
Crying as it hits the ground
Rain, rain in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Rain, rain
Falling rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Falling rain

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll go outside
And walk beneath the clouds
Pretend it's you that's watching over me
This isn't the only thing that comes between us now
Baby, soon we'll be together

[Break]
(Everywhere I look I see the rain)
(Everywhere I look I see the rain)
Rain
(Everywhere I look I see the rain)
Everywhere I look I see rain
(Everywhere I look I see the rain)
Rain
(Everywhere I look I see the rain)
Rain
(Rain, rain in the sky)
(Everywhere I look my eyes see rain)
Rain
(Rain falling down)
Down
(Crying as it hits the ground)
Don't, don't let it hit the ground
(Rain, rain in my heart everyday that we're apart)
(Rain, rain)
Rain
(Falling rain, rain)
Rain
(Rain, rain)

[Chorus]
Everywhere I look I see the rain
Everywhere I look I see the rain
But I don't see you
You're not near me
I need you... ooh
Rain
It'll never be the same
If you don't stop the rain
