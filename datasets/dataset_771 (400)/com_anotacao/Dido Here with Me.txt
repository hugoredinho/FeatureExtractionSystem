[Verse 1]
I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't want to move a thing
It might change my memory

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

[Chorus 1]
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

[Verse 2]
Don't want to call my friends
For they might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

[Chorus 2]
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

[Chorus 2]
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me
