[Verse 1]
If we're talking about love
Then I have to tell you
Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed
I've gotten lost before
I've woke up stone drunk
Face down in the floor

[Chorus]
Late afternoon, the house is hot
I started, I jumped up
Everyone hates a bore
Everybody hates a drunk

[Verse 2]
This may be a lip invention
Professors muddled in their intent
To try to rope in followers
To float their malcontent
As for this reader
I'm already spent

[Chorus]
Late afternoon, the house is hot
I started, I jumped up
Everyone hates a sad professor
I hate where I wound up

[Verse 3]
Dear readers, my apologies
I'm drifting in and out of sleep
Long silence presents the tragedies
Of love. Note the age. Get afraid
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks

[Chorus]
Late afternoon, the house is hot
I started, I jumped up
Everyone hates a bore
Everybody hates a drunk
Everyone hates a sad professor
I hate where I wound up
I hate where I wound up
