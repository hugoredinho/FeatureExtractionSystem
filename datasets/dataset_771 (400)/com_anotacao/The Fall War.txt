[Verse 1]
Do you remember standing on a broken field
White crippled wings beating the sky
The harbingers of war with their nature revealed
And our chances flowing by

[Pre-Chorus]
If I can let the memory heal
I will remember you with me on that field

[Chorus]
When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me a reason to try

[Verse 2]
Turn the page I need to see something new
For now my innocence is torn
We cannot linger on this stunted view
Like rabid dogs of war

[Pre-Chorus]
I will let the memory heal
I'll remember you with me on that field

[Chorus]
When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
And we fought to believe the impossible
When I thought that I fought this war alone
We were one with our destinies entwined
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me the reason why

[Bridge]
With no-one wearing their real face
It's a whiteout of emotion
And I've only got my brittle bones to break the fall
When the love in letters fade
It's like moving in slow motion
And we're already too late if we arrive at all
And then we're caught up in the arms race
An involuntary addiction
And we're shedding every value our mothers taught
So will you please show me your real face
Draw the line in the horizon
'Cause I only need your name to call the reasons why I fought

[Chorus]
When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
And we fought to believe the impossible
When I thought that I fought this war alone
We were one with our destinies entwined
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me the reason why
