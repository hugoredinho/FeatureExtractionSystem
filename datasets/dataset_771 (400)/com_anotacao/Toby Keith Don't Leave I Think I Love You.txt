[Chorus]
Don't leave, I think I love you
I just saw the rest of my life, honey you're in it
Won't you hear what I say, give me a minute
Don't leave, I think I love you
I know you think I'm crazy, and you probably should
I wouldn't make this up, I couldn't dream this good

[Verse 1]
Now baby don't tell me that I missed my chance
I haven't heard last call, would you like to dance?
I've been sitting here waiting on you all night
Why don't you give me that old good-to-go green light
Am I coming on strong, baby moving kind of fast
I'm rushing along but at least I got to ask
I couldn't live with myself if you got away
I'm a love sick puppy, baby what do you say?

[Chorus]
Don't leave, I think I love you
I just saw the rest of my life, honey you're in it
Won't you hear what I say, give me a minute
Don't leave, I think I love you
I know you think I'm crazy, and you probably should
I wouldn't make this up, I couldn't dream this good

[Verse 2]
It's late and been a long night, you're tired I know
Aw, don't break my heart, baby please don't go
It ain't the whiskey talking, ain't this neon light
You see I've fallen stone-cold in love at first sight
Going to cut to the chase, baby get right to it
I got a lot to say and a short time to do it
Aw, don't walk away honey I'm just trying to
Aw listen to me talking, I'm a babbling fool

[Chorus]
Don't leave, I think I love you
I just saw the rest of my life, honey you're in it
Won't you hear what I say, give me a minute
Don't leave, I think I love you
I know you think I'm crazy, and you probably should
I wouldn't make this up, I couldn't dream this good

[Outro]
Really baby, don't leave
I think I love you
I know you think I'm crazy, and you probably should
I wouldn't make this up, I couldn't dream this good
