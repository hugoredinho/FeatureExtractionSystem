[Samples]
"Gimme that Thorazine, man -"
"You don't need the Thorazine, relax, RELAX!"
"-I need that Thorazine"
"Never trust a junkie"

[Verse 1]
Blood keeps drinking away
Silence of desperation
Driving through New Orleans at night
Trying to find a destination

[Chorus]
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)

[Verse 2]
Life keeps slipping away
Fighting in a war with damnation
Poised, keep cutting away
I'm looking in through to salvation

[Chorus]
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)

[Sample]
"Just one fix"
"Just one fix"
"Just one fix"
"Just one fix"
"Just one fix"
"Just one fix"
"Just one fix"
"Just one fix"

[Sample]
"Monkey never dies"
"Monkey never dies"

[Verse 3]
Monkey starts driving a train
Trying to take in another station
Join us, and the choice will be made
Unless we kill the lie as a nation

[Chorus]
Just one fix ("just one fix")
Just one fix ("just one fix")
Just one fix ("just one fix")
Just one fix ("just one fix")
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix, one fix)
Just one fix...
