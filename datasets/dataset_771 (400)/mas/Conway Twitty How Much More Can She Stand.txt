[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
There's a devil in my body that I just can't satisfy
Other women haunt me even though I love my wife
It's because I really love her I try to save her heart with lies
But I know she knows, I can see it in her eyes

[Verse 2]
I tried to stay at home, love only her, play with the kids and watch TV
But then my mind becomes unsure about the kind of love I need
My reasons for cheating, they're as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand and still stand by me

[Verse 3]
It's so hard for me to call her, I can hardly dial the phone
I did wrong again last night, now, I just want to go back home
She knows that I lied, Lord, she'll cry where I can't see
How much more can she stand and still stand by me
