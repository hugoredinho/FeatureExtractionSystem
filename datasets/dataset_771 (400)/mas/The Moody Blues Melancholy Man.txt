[Intro]

I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am
All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground
I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see

When all the stars are falling down
Into the sea and on the ground
And angry voices carry on the wind

A beam of light will fill your head
And you'll remember what's been said
By all the good men this world's ever known

Another man is what you'll see
Who looks like you and looks like me
And yet somehow he will not feel the same

His life caught up in misery
He doesn't think like you and me
Cause he can't see what you and I can see

[Bridge]

When all the stars are falling down
Into the sea and on the ground
And angry voices carry on the wind

A beam of light will fill your head
And you'll remember what's been said
By all the good men this world's ever known

Another man is what you'll see
Who looks like you and looks like me
And yet somehow he will not feel the same

His life caught up in misery (a very lonely man)
He doesn't think like you and me (a very lonely man)
Cause he can't see what you and I can see

I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am
All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground
I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can (A beam of light will fill your head, And you'll remember what's been said
By all the good men this world's ever known)
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see

[Outro]

(When all the stars are falling down
Into the sea and on the ground...)

I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am
All the world surrounds me
I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
That we're going to keep growing, just you wait and see

Oh, believe me, believe me, believe me
I'm a melancholy man
