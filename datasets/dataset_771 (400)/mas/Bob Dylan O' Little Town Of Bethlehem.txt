[Verse 1]
O' little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shine
An everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

[Verse 2]
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of all His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in
Amen
