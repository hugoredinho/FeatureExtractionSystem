[Verse 1]
Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children always fighting for a share
And the six-o-nine goes roaring down the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his service for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really looking fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I'd fix the barn
Poor old girl, she needs a man down on the farm

[Chorus]
And it's good old country comforts in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones
Country comfort's any road that's going home, woohoo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Down at the well they've got a new machine
Foreman says it cuts manpower by fifteen
"And oh, but that ain't natural" old man Clayson says
Cause he's a horse-drawn man until his dying days

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And it's good old country comforts in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones
Country comfort's any road that's going home
And it's good old country comforts in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones, woohoo
Country comfort's any road that's going home
And it's good old country comforts in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones
Country comfort's any road that's going home
Country comfort's any road that's going home
Country comfort's any road that's going home
Country comfort's any road that's going home
