[Verse 1]
Sometimes you think you'll be fine by yourself
'Cause a dream is a wish that you make all alone
It's easy to feel like you don't need help
But it's harder to walk on your own
You'll change inside, when you realize

[Chorus]
The world comes to life, and everything's right
From beginning to end, when you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find
The beauty you are when you open your heart
And believe in the gift of a friend
The gift of a friend

[Verse 2]
Someone who knows when you're lost and you're scared
There through the highs and the lows
Someone to count on
Someone who cares
Beside you wherever you'll go
You'll change inside, when you realize

[Chorus]
The world comes to life, and everything's right
From beginning to end, when you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find
The beauty you are when you open your heart
And believe in the gift of a friend

[Bridge]
And when your hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground
You, you feel all alone
When you don't know which way to go
And there's no signs leading you home
You're not alone

[Chorus]
The world comes to life, and everything's bright
From beginning to end, when you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find
The beauty you are when you open your heart
And believe in
When you believe in
When you believe in the gift of a friend
Ooh-ooh
