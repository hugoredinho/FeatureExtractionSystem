[Verse 1]
Through falling leaves I pick my way slowly
Talking aloud, eases my mind
Sunlight filters through, I feel my head is bursting
So full of thoughts, I thought of
What am I going to do?
I need some thoughts that are new

[Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo
Dee-dee-dee-dee dee dee-dee dee-dee-dee-dee
Nature enter me

[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
Up in a tree a bird sings so sweetly
Nature's own voice, I hear
Rustling whistling trees turning breeze to speech
Talk to me now, ease my mind
I'll turn something new
Mind's laid with dew

[Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo
Dee-dee-dee-dee dee dee-dee dee-dee-dee-dee
Nature enter me

[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

I'll turn something new
Mind's laid with dew

[Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo
Dee-dee-dee-dee dee dee-dee dee-dee-dee-dee
Nature enter me
