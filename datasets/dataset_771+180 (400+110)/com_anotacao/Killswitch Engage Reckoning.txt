[Intro/Chorus]
You are no god to me
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning

[Verse 1]
Enjoy this while it lasts
It won't be long before it dies
You've stolen lies and broken dreams
No man can be a deity

[Chorus 1]
You are no god to me
This is a reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning

[Verse 2]
Was the penance not enough?
Was faith not enough?
No man can be a deity

[Chorus 2]
You are no god to me
This is a reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning
And I will be there
To see you fall
You are no god to me
There is the reckoning

[Verse 3]
The betrayed will now see the truth
And the broken-hearted will finally heal
You will be judged and you will be found wanting
(You will be judged and you will be found wanting)
And we'll be there to see you fall

[Chorus 2]
You are no god to me
This is the reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is a reckoning
And I will be there
To see you fall
You are no god to me
There is a reckoning
