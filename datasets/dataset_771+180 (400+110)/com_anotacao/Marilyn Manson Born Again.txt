[Verse 1]
Do you or don't you want this to be your song?
It doesn't take a rebel to sing along
This art is weak in its pretty, pretty frame
And I am your monkey with a misspelled name

[Pre-Chorus]
"I'll put down you disco and take your heart away"
"I'll put down you disco and take your heart away"
I'll be born again

[Chorus]
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

[Verse 2]
Do you or don't you want to take this hit?
Does it make you feel like you're a part of "it"?

[Pre-Chorus]
"I'll put down you disco and take your heart away"
"I'll put down you disco and take your heart away"
I'll be born again

[Chorus]
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

[Bridge]
The valley of the dolls is the valley of the dead
The valley of the dolls is the valley of the dead

[Chorus]
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

[Outro]
"I'll put down you disco and take your heart away"
"I'll put down you disco and take your heart away"
I'll be born again, I'll be born again
I'll be born again, I'll be born again
