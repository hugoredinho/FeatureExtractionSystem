[Verse 1]
Suddenly before my eyes
Hues of indigo arise
With them how my spirit sighs
Paint the sky with stars

[Verse 2]
Only night will ever know
Why the heavens never show
All the dreams there are to know
Paint the sky with stars

[Chorus]
Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly?
As the heavens seem so far
Now who will paint the midnight star?

[Verse 3]
Night has brought to those who sleep
Only dreams they cannot keep
I have legends in the deep
Paint the sky with stars

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly?
As the heavens seem so far
Now who will paint the midnight star?

[Verse 4]
Place a name upon the night
One to set your heart alight
And to make the darkness bright
Paint the sky with stars
