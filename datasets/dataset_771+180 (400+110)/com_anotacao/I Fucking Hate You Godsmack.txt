[Verse 1]
For everything you do
I’d like to swallow you
And everyday I’m gonna blame you
And even if you justify
Every fucking bullshit lie
It only makes me want to break you

[Pre-Chorus]
You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It’s broken now
Don’t ever look my way
Don’t even think I’m playin’

[Chorus]
‘Cause I fucking hate you
You’re such a liar
And I’d love to hang you
You’re all the same to me

[Verse 2]
When you repeatedly
Take advantage of me
The only thought I get of you sickens me
Everybody knows you’re fake
You’re everything I fucking hate
And I’m everything that you could never be

[Pre-Chorus]
You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It’s broken now
Don’t ever look my way
Don’t even think I’m playin’

[Chorus]
‘Cause I fucking hate you
You’re such a liar
And I’d love to hang you
You’re all the same to me
I fucking hate you
You’re such a liar
And I love to hate you
You’re all the same to me
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)

[Pre-Chorus]
You pull me down
And you crucify my name
You make me insane
It’s broken now
Don’t ever look my way
Don’t even think I’m playin’

[Chorus]
‘Cause I fucking hate you
You’re such a liar
And I’d love to hang you
You’re all the same to me
And I fucking hate you
You’re such a liar
And I’d love to hang you
You’re all the same to me
Fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you)
