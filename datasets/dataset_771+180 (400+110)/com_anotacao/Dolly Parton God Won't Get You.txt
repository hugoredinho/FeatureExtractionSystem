[Verse 1]
Sometimes in my sleep I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could sleep and dream again
Cause only in my dreams can I know how it might have been
But cheaters never win, their heartaches never end

[Verse 2]
But sometimes I get crazy as lovers often do
Trying to please him and wondering if she's pleasing you
Though they have every right to any part of us they choose
I still live just for you and our secret rendezvous

[Chorus]
Torn between two lovers on the jukebox
I'm thinking how I could have wrote that song
Wondering if God loves us when we're cheating
Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong
And I guess I should be signing "Rock of Ages"
"Amazing Grace" and some of those good songs
But my cheating heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong

[Verse 3]
Thou shalt not commit it, it's written in the "Ten"
The spirit's always willing, but the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven as I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right

[Chorus]
Torn between two lovers just keeps playing
I don't want to be right if loving you is wrong
I'm wondering if God loves us when we're cheating
Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong?
And I guess I should be singing "Rock of Ages"
"Amazing Grace" and some of those good songs
But my cheating heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong

[Outro]
My cheating heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
