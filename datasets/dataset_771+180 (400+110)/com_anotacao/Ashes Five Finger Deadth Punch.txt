[Intro]
Right
Hate, hate, hate!
Bring it!

[Verse 1]
You don't understand me
And you probably never will
I got a tendency to self-destruct
And a soft spot for the filth
A hair-trigger temperament
A switchblade for a tongue
I'm a walking one-man genocide
With a black belt in corrupt

[Chorus 1]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

[Chorus 2]
Love me, hate me
Isolate me every day that I'm alive
Straight-up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life

[Verse 2]
I'm a jinx, a curse; some say, "The worst"
I'm a savage, rabid beast
I've been called so many fucking things
It doesn't affect me in the least!
I've stolen, lied, been crucified
But I don't regret a thing
I'm an 
egocentric
 
masochist
With a sadist's point of bleak

[Chorus]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

[Chorus 2]
Love me, hate me
Isolate me every day that I'm alive
Live to prove you wrong, it's easy
When your heart is filled with ice
Chapters in my life define me
Changed me into this deprived
Straight-up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life

[Outro]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands
