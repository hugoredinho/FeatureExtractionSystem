[Verse 1]
You need my love, baby, oh so bad
You're not the only one I've ever had
And if I say I want to set you free
Don't you know you'll be in misery

[Chorus]
They call me (Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (Calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinking of (Calling Dr. Love)

[Verse 2]
And even though I'm full of sin
In the end, you'll let me in
You'll let me through, there's nothing you can do
You need my loving, don't you know it's true

[Verse 3]
So answer, please, get on your knees
There are no bills, there are no fees
Baby, I know what your problem is
The first step of the cure is a kiss

[Chorus]
So call me (Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (Calling Dr. Love)
I am your doctor of love (Calling Dr. Love) Ha!
They call me (Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (Calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinking of (Calling Dr. Love)

[Instrumental break 2:01-2:30]

[Chorus]
Ooh, they call me (Dr. Love)
I am the doctor of love (Calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinking of (Calling Dr. Love)
Ooh, they call me (Dr. Love)
I am your doctor of love (Calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinking of (Calling Dr. Love),  ooh yeah

[Outro]
Love, love, love, (Dr. Love)
