[Verse 1]
There comes a time
To be free of the heart
I want to be ready
Ready to start
On a love journey
Got places to go
Made up my mind
And I have got to let you know

[Chorus]
Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
Because I decided right now
I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)
I I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)

[Verse 2]
A funny feeling's coming
Over me
Now I'm inspired and open to being
In a love place
But it's out of my hands
I'm telling you baby that you got to understand baby

[Chorus]
Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
Because I decided right now
I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)
Ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)

[Verse 3]
I can't see what's out there for me
And I know love offers no guarantee
I'll take a chance and I'm
Telling you something babe
I got to let you know (oh)

[Chorus]
Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
Because I decided right now
I'm ready for love (I'm ready for love)
I'm ready for love

[Outro]
Ready for love
Take a chance
Take the chance on love
The heart, the fool
Ah ah ah ah
