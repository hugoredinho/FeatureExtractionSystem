[Verse 1]
Four years old, with my back to the door
All I could hear was the family war
Your selfish hands always expecting more
Am I your child, or just a charity ward?

[Pre-Chorus]
You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless

[Chorus]
Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh

[Verse 2]
It's been five years since we've spoken last
And you can't take back what we never had
Oh, I can be manipulated only so many times
Before even "I love you" starts to sound like a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless

[Chorus]
Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter

[Bridge]
Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you push me out of your world?
Lied to your flesh and your blood
Put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved
Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you throw me right out of your world?
So young when the pain had begun
Now forever afraid of being loved

[Breakdown]
Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father

[Outro]
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
For the love of a daughter
