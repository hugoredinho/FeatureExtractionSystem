[Intro:]
Please remember me forever
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

[Verse 1:]
I’m gonna tell you what I think about you
In that unforgivable way I do
You’re an idiot
And I hate your guts

I guess I’m about as happy for you
As I would be a cockroach in my food
I know it’s terrible
I really hate you though

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do you have your fairytale lie?
Are you dancing to the white trash twist?

[Chorus:]
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

[Verse 2:]
I heard everything that you hate about me
Almost every day, but you still wouldn’t leave
I had to pull the plug
Ooh, I hated your guts

And I heard the opposite of love isn’t hate
It’s indifference, but I can’t relate
It’s not good enough
'Cause I hate your guts

[Pre-Chorus:]
Did you settle your mediocre mind?
You had the fine wine, you're better off with Bud Light

[Chorus:]
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who wants you to go to hell

[Bridge:]
You’re raining, you’re boring
Oh, did you hear me snoring?
I’d wanna mutilate myself when I’d talk to you

[Verse 3:]
So here we have it, I hope you can tell
That I’m no referral, you can have ‘em call hell
You’re gonna drive ‘em nuts
They’re gonna hate your guts

[Chorus:]
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who wants you to go to hell

[Chorus - Repeated:]
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who wants you to go to hell
