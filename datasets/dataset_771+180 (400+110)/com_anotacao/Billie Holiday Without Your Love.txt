[Verse 1]
Without your love
I'm like a song without words
Just like a nest without birds
Without your love

[Verse 2]
The sun above
Will never shine at my door
My life holds nothing in store
Without your love

[Chorus]
I rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea

[Verse 3]
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love

[Chorus]
I rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea

[Verse 3]
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love
