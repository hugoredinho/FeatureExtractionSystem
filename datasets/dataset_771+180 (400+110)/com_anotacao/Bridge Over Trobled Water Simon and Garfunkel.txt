[Verse 1]
When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

[Chorus]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 2]
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

[Chorus]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 3]
Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

[Chorus]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
