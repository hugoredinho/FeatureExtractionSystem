[Verse 1]
The mood is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 2]
The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Bridge]
The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 3]
The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
And don't look down

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Bridge]
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

[Verse 4]
The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 1]
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

[Chorus]
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh Christmas time
