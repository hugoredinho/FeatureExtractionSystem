[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
You're my favorite, of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
Yes, you're my favorite, of my favors
You're my razor, oh no

[Chorus]
Hey!
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
Come
Come
Come

[Verse 2]
You're my favorite, of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
Yes, you're my favorite, of my favors
You're my razor, oh no

[Chorus]
Hey!
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
Come
Come
Come

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You're my favorite, of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
Yes, you're my favorite, of my favors
You're my razor, oh no

[Chorus]
Hey!
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around, to remind me what not to become
Come
Come
Come
