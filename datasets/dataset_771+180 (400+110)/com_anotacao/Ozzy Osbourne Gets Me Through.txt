[Verse 1]
I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the anti-Christ or the iron man
I have a vision that I just can't control
I feel I've lost my spirit and sold my soul
Got no control

[Chorus]
I try to entertain you the best I can
I wish I'd started walking before I ran
But I still love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop 'cause it gets me through yeah
It gets me through yeah

[Verse 2]
The feelings that I hide behind
Sometimes reality's unkind
The nightmares stalk for me at night
I dread the long and lonely nights

[Chorus]
I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the anti-Christ or the iron man
But I still love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop 'cause it gets me through yeah

[Outro]
I'm just trying to live yeah [x4]
