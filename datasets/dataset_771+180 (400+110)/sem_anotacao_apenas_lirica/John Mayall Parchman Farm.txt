I'm sitting over here on parchman farm
I'm sitting over here on parchman farm
I'm sitting over here on parchman farm
Ain't never done no man no harm

Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack
Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack
Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack
A twelve-gauge shotgun at my back

I'm sitting over here on parchman farm
I'm sitting over here on parchman farm
I'm sitting over here on parchman farm
Ain't never done no man no harm
