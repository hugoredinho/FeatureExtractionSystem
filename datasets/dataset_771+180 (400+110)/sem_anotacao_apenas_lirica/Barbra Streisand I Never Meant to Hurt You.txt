I never meant to hurt you
I'm not that way at all
Please believe the words of the heart
A heart that seems so small
And I swear I never meant to hurt you
I guess i lost my place
Please, believe the wards of the heart
A heart that hides it's fails
Why do I do things
I never mean to do?
Oh, why did I speak so carelessly
When all that i felt

Was love for you?
And i swear I never
I never meant to hurt you
I've got to make you know
Please, believe the words of the heart
A heart that didn't show
I never meant to hurt you
I only meant to love you
It's true
And when I saw you crying
I cried too...
