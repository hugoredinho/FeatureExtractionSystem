When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your windowpane
To a place behind the sun
Just a step beyond the rain
Somewhere, over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of
Once in a lullabye
Somewhere, over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are
Far
Behind me
Where laughter falls like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere, over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?
