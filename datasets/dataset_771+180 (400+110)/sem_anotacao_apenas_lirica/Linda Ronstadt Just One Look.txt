Just one look
And I fell so hard
In love
With you
Oh oh

I found out
How good it feels
To have
Your love
Oh oh

Say you will
Will be mine
Forever
And always
Oh oh

Just one look
And I knew
That you
Were my only one
Oh oh

I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong
Oh yeah yeah
Ah but I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can make you
Make you my own

So you see
I really care
Without you
I'm nothin'
Oh oh

Just one look
And I know
I'll get you
Someday
Oh oh

Just one look
That's all it took, hey
Just one look
That's all it took, woah
Just one look
That's it was baby
You know I love you baby
I'll build my world around you
Come on baby
