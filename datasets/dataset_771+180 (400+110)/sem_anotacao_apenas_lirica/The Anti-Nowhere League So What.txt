Another boring night and I'm feeling pissed
My heads fucked up and I'm in a mess
Too many drugs have made me high
I want to 'cause havoc, I want to die

We are the League, with the extra man
We are the League, we are the anti band
So don't you say you're feeling bored
The League are here and we have scored

We are the League
We are the League
We are the League
The Anti Nowhere League

You criticize us, you say were shit
But were up here and were doing it
So don't you criticize the things we do
No fucker pays to go and see you

We are the League and we are mad
We are the League and our musics bad
Well fuck noise like you've never known
And make you wished you'd stayed at home

We are the League
We are the League
We are the League
The Anti Nowhere League

We hate the dogs, we hate the man
We hate the things we don't understand
No time for love, 'cause that ain't class
If you don't fucking like it, stuff it up your arse

We are the League and we are mean
We are the League and were obscene
We don't give a toss for what you think
'cause all your views, they fucking stink

We are the League
We are the League
We are the League 
So don't fuck with the League!
