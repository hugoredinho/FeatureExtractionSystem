I can't stop loving you so I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago, still make me blue
And they say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

I can't stop love you, so I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
