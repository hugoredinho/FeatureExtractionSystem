Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me
The judge said, "Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it ment my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife
Now the schaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But some times at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me
