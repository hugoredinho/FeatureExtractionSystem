Juliet, Juliet
You've got the smile that I can't forget
On the day we met I made a bet
Some day I'll win the love of Juliet
Long as the sand, bright as the sun
Where have you been since my life begun
Girl you're the one that I want to know
Juliet let me be your Romeo
Friendly smile a sexy walk
A charming little accent when you talk
You're an eleven on a scale of ten
Juliet I just wanna say it again
Just a little bit shy, just a little bit quiet
I don't mind, I'm in love and I can't deny it
