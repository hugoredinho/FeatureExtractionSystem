Oil remove shred and tear
Radiation vapor air
It's the fear so unclear
Man in motion going nowhere
In our homes stuck in the face
Spread the word to the populace
Yellow journal, yellow journal
Set the pace, feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort
So insidious off the point
Simple solution, never confusion
Sport a gun, kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought
So receive me had enough
Lock me up, lock me up
Rot and assimilate
Hot to annihilate
(Tear your face)
Rot and assimilate
So hot to annihilate
(Hit with mace)
Is it safe?
Deviation tonic mess
Prolonged existence innocence
Is he who speaks isn't weak
Wheelchair virtue so to speak
Bubonic plague, the truth of aids
Immunity avoid decay
In the trench of pestilence
The bible screams announce your faith
Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal, it's all sensation
Protect design the moral plan
Infallible as propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back
Hot to assimilate
(Go nowhere)
Rot or annihilate
(Tell yourself)
Hot to assimilate
(Search your soul)
We'll rot or annihilate
Agony
Inner thinking brain
Clanking chains
Growing pain
Is it safe?
Bloodshot
Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal, it's all sensation
Protect design the moral plan
Infallible as propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back
Agony profusely stains
The inner thinking of the brain
Accusations, clanking chains
Experiments with the groans of pain
All prefer no one blames
The terror in an animal's screams
In cages our future
The answers insane
Rot and assimilate
(Show no faith)
So hot to annihilate
(Each adds assimilate)
Rot and assimilate
(Each one assimilates)
So hot to annihilate
Reach for an air way
Reach for an air way
Reach for an air way
Reach for an air way
Reach for an air way
Oh, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death
