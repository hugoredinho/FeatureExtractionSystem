Look at the way he looks at her
Look at the way he smiles
I remember when he was mine
I remember when things were fine, oh
Look at the way he looks at her, now
Isn't that the look of love?
Look at the way he holds her hand
Look at the way they dance
I remember when he loved me
I remember how it used to be, but
Look at the way he smiles at her, now
Isn't that the look of love?
Here I am all by myself
Watching him with someone else
Bet he doesn't even know I'm here
Wish I could hold back my tears, but...
Look at the way he's kissing her
Look at him hold her tight
I remember his warm embrace
And the tender look on his face, yes
Look at the way he looks at her, now
Isn't that the look of love?
Isn't that the look of love? Woh, oh, oh
Isn't that the look of love? Hey, hey, hey
Isn't that the look of love? Oh, oh, now
Isn't that the look of love? Hey, yay
Isn't that the look of love? Oh, oh, oh...
