Woe is me
I'm as blue as anyone can be
I feel like a weepin' willow tree
I'm in a cryin' mood

Pair by pair
I see happy lovers everywhere
But the one I love don't seem to care
I'm in a cryin' mood

Each day I'm by my own-some
Blue Mondays rain or shine
I'll say this world is lonesome
I'm just the lonesome kind

Why, oh, why
Did he have to go and say goodbye?
Seems the moon is low and so am I
I'm in a cryin' mood

Each day I'm by my own-some
Blue Mondays rain or shine
I'll say this world is lonesome
I'm just the lonesome kind

Oh, why, oh, why
Did he have to go and say goodbye?
Seems the moon is low and so am I
I'm in a cryin' mood
