[Verse 1]
Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock 'n' Roll High School
Well I don't care about history
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Because that's not where I wanna be
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I just want to have some kicks
I just want to get some chicks
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school

[Verse 2]
Well the girls out there knock me out, you know
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Cruising around in my GTO
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I hate the teachers and the principal
Don't want to be taught to be no fool
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school

[Outro]
Fun fun rock and roll high school
Fun fun rock and roll high school
Fun fun rock and roll high school
Fun fun, oh baby, Fun Fun, oh baby, fun fun
Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock 'n' roll high school
