[Verse 1]
Playground school bell rings again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you she's not breathing?
Hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to
Hello

[Verse 2]
If I smile and don't believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken
Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
Don't cry

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello, I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday
