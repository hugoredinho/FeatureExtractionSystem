I'm making believe that you're in my arms
Though I know you're so far away
Making believe I'm talking to you
Wish you could hear what I say
And here in the gloom of my lonely room
We're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreaming
So till my dreams come true
I'll whisper, "Good night"
Turn out the light and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
I'm making believe that you're in my arms
Though I know you're so far away
Making believe I'm talkin' to you
Wish you could hear what I say
And here in the gloom of my lonely room
We're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreamin'
So till my dreams come true
I'll whisper, "Good night"
Turn out the light and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
And here in the gloom of my lonely room
We're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreamin'
So till my dreams come true
I'll whisper, "Good night"
Turn out the light and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
