Got my eye on a boy
He's eying me back
It's looking real good
This could be it
But I know that all of you girls
Would love to steal him away

He bought me a drink
I thanked him real sweet
It's always so nice when you first meet
And I know that all of you women
Would love to steal him away
So I'm warning you

Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend

Pretty as a picture
Coming on so strong
He's twisting my ignition key
Turn my motor on
But anyone can see all his attention's on me
Give us some privacy

Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a waste of time to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend

Leave us alone tonight
Then if it don't work out right
He's all yours
Until then

Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
They're crowding in on me
Moving in suspiciously
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Working up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a waste of time to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
