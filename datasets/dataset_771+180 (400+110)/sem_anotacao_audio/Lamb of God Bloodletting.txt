Archaic methods transfer through
Well in the face of mass denial
Bitterness fuels the mode
For the escape of mediocrity
Stepping the grate
Shattered nerves ground down
To a glass edge carrying me away
Bloodletting a favorite game of solitaire
A suicide mission destined to fail
A moving ladder to climb taking me away
I wouldn't have it any other way
