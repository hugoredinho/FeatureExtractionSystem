[Instrumental Intro]

He had an unfamiliar face
Complete life in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside, I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror - please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin?

[Short Instrumental Break]

I'm not one to be forgot
Spoiled rotten, or so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few, but so many have to pay

Deep inside, I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror - please look inside
Can you see the reasons that we sin?

[Instrumental Break]

Pressure coming down - down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails digging in, scratch my face
Nervous like a cat, gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall stretching out, grope for me

(Reasons) Deep in me
(Reasons) Let me be
(Reasons) Let me bleed
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) The reasons that we sin
