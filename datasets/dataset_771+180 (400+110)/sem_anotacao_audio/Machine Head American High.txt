I was that kid sittin' over in the corner
Smiling with a shit-eating grin
And I was that kid smilin' In the back of class
Cause I'm flyin' on mescaline
I was that kid drinkin' 40's on the bleachers
Getting drunk after school
Gettin' home too late, fallin' on my face
Way too drunk to skate
And actin' a fool

I was that kid never doing good at
Nothing except for maybe at P.E
And I was that kid getting bullied by the
Filipinos rollin' with ABT
Me and my friends reading
The Satanic Bible, thinking we should start a band
Cutting class to jam, cutting class to jam
In my dad's garage we learned to

Act a fool - don't need to be cool
Pissed off too and breaking the rules
Mama told me stay in school
Don't rock 'n roll
But this is my American high

I was that kid prank-calling your girlfriend
Couldn't get a goddamn date
And I was that kid that was
Getting hella busted for pissin' on the bart train
I fuckin' hated school, except for hanging out with my friends
The outcast that was startin' up a band
Fremont was the town, California-bound
Bay area sound, taught me to

Act a fool - don't need to be cool
Pissed off too and breaking the rules
Mama told me stay in school
Don't rock 'n roll
But this is my American high

I'm that kid you tried to punk in English class
Now I'm in a band and your kissin' my ass

Asteroids beat out homework
Slayer beat out Zeppelin
Not the sharpest noggin
That's why I'm in this band

And what you got against me, I don't need a new job
What you got against me, I'll get by on my own
Tellin' me I'm never gettin' by from songs
I love it when you're proven wrong

Act a fool - don't need to be cool
Pissed off too and breaking the rules
Mama told me stay in school
Don't rock 'n roll
But this is my American high

Act a fool - don't need to be cool
Break the rules
Cause this is my American high
