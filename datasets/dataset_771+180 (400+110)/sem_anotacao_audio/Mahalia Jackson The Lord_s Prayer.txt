Our Father, which art in Hea-veen
Hallo-wed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On-d Earth (aith) as it is in hea-ven
Geev us this day, our daily bread;

And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors

And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from ee-vill:
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glo-o-ry
Forever, A-a-a-main
