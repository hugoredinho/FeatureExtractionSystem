As we're sitting here, staring each other down
You open up your mouth, let your lies spew out
What are we doing here? It's wrong, can't you see?
You wanna leave me here, and forget about me

You look me, in my face
Tell me I'm, a disgrace

You say that you're the victim
I say you're full of shit

All the times you stuck me here
And put me on my own
I feel the same, that's why
I've got a bullet with your name

As we're sitting here, staring each other down
I remember how you used to kick me around
Look deep in my eyes, come take all my pain
I only have just one bullet with your name

You look me, in my face
Tell me I'm, a disgrace

You say that you're the victim
I say you're full of shit

All the times you stuck me here
And put me on my own
I feel the same, that's why
I've got a bullet with your name

That's why
GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!

Look deep in my eyes
Come take the pain from me
All I ask of you
Is to get away from me

You look me, in my face
Tell me I'm, a disgrace

You say that you're the victim
I say you're full of shit

All the times you stuck me here
And put me on my own
I feel the same, that's why
I've got a bullet with your name

All the times you stuck me here
And put me on my own
I feel the same, that's why
I've got a bullet with your name
