[Intro, spoken]

[Nikki]
I've had enough, and I want out!

[Metal box thrown off table, hits floor]

[Dr. X]
You can't walk away now. [Laughs]

[Instrumentation begins, Verse 1]
I looked back once
And all I saw was his face
Smiling, the needle crying
Walking out of his room with mirrors
Afraid, I heard him scream
'You'll never get away'

[Verse 2]
Cold and shaking
I crawled down alleys to try
And scrape away 
the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall

[Chorus]
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Wet and raving
The needle keeps calling me back
To bloody my hands forever
Carved my cure with the blade
That left me in scars
Now every time I'm weak
Words scream from my arm

[Extended Chorus]
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name
