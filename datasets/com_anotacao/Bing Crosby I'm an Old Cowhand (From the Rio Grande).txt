[Verse 1]
I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande
But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tanned
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow
Never roped a steer cause I don't know how
Sure ain't a fixin' to start in now

[Chorus]
Oh, 
yippie yi yo kayah
Yippie yi yo kayah

[Verse 2]
I'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande
And I learned to ride, ride, ride 'fore I learned to stand
I'm a ridin' fool who is up to date
I know every trail in the Lone Star State
Cause I ride the range in a Ford V8

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We're old cowhands from the Rio Grande
And we come to town just to hear the band
We know all the songs that the cowboys know
'Bout the Big Corral where the doggies go
We learned them all on the radio

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I'm an old cowhand, down from the Rio Grande
Oh, where the West is wild all around the Borderland
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo
And the engines run up a rug or two
And the old Bar X is just a barbecue, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
I'm a pioneer who began from scratch
I don't bat an eye in a shootin' match
They don't call me 'Elmer', they call me 'Satch'

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Get along little horsey, get along little horsey
