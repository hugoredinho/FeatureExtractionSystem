You are my main man

[Verse 1]
Golden nose Slim

I knows where you've been
Purple pie Pete

Your lips are like lightning
Girls melt in the heat

[Chorus]

You're my main man

[Verse 2]
Bobby's alright
Bobby's alright
He's a natural born poet
He's just outta sight
Jungle faced Jake
Jungle faced Jake
I said make no mistake
About jungle faced Jake, Jake

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Bobby's alright
Bobby's alright
He's a natural born poet
He's just outta sight
Automatic shoes
Automatic shoes
Give me 3-D vision
And the California blues
Me I funk
But I don't care
I ain't no square
With my corkscrew hair

[Chorus]

You're my main man
