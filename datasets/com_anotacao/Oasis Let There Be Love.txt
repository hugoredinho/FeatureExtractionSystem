[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Liam Gallagher]
Who kicked a hole in the sky so the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun in a world come undone at the seams?
Let there be love, let there be love

I hope the weather is calm as you sail up your heavenly stream
Suspended clear in the sky are the words that we sing in our dreams

[Chorus: Liam Gallagher]
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

[Verse 2: Noel Gallagher]
Come on baby blue
Shake up your tired eyes
The world is waiting for you
May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
But if it makes you happy
Keep on clapping
Just remember I'll be by your side
And if you don't let go, it's gonna pass you by

[Bridge: Liam Gallagher]
Who kicked a hole in the sky so the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun in a world come undone at the seams?

[Chorus: Liam Gallagher]
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

[Chorus: Liam Gallagher]
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

Let there be love
