[Intro: Stide Prince]
Like you know
If you see a real one baby
Like if you see a real one
You see kiss one
I got my niggas with me

[Verse 1: Stide Prince]
I'ma just a young nigga dreams of the villa
Put me in the picture bet I make that shit iller
Put me in the booth bet I make that shit killer
Ain't non realer little chip turn gorilla
City where Im from all they have is close caskets
Damage young niggas trying gain some status
All I wanna do is play with her cabbage
Everytime I change the channel all I get is static
Your level my nigga I done pass it
Your bitch open her mouth so my weed I could ash it
And I recorded it you should see it
Its a classic thats no laughing
Put me on a pedestal cause I'm a cool dude
I'm a slick one yea I'm a slick one
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But it wasn't me you just miss one

[Hook: Stide Prince]
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But it wasn't me you just miss one
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But it wasn't me you just miss one

[Verse 2: Stide Prince]
I'm just a go getter nigga on a journey
You see what you want then nigga go get her
Girl focus on your funds and not no nigga
You could flip their whole mode like Ra Ra Digga
I bust a rhymes (BustaRhymes) plenty of times
It kept me sane kept me from out of my mind
From the streets to the booth from the booth to the streets
From the schools to the beach all the way to middle east
Just listen when a architect speak
Theres jews when a nigga drop heat
Intellect but I gotta choose beefs
I rather choose paper either currency or lose leaf
Either way yall know a nigga ain't cheap

[Hook: Stide Prince]
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But it wasn't me you done miss one
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But it wasn't me you just miss one

[Verse 3: Phillie Doss]
I'm just a gorilla dreams of the scrilla
Stress out smoking on killer
Trying kill everything like them boys up in Illinois
Real shit is missing I will fill a void
Its funny how the words of a mob
Is that he ain't on his job
How is that but he is still employed
Hold up I say Im still employed
Aye so tell me how in hell I ain't on my J.O.B
All this work that I put In through shots in the dark
But Im no Cuba Gooding
Had to let you out the car you said that you ride
But we knew that you wouldn't
Good kid mad city Im a young Trey
Never worry about the labels
Cause I already knew I will grow to be a real nigga one day
And thats despite all the the dope and the gunplay

[Hook: Phillie Doss]
So in that case
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But it wasn't me you just miss one
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But if it wasn't me you just miss

[Hook:Stide Prince]
If you see a real nigga you should kiss one
But if it wasn't me you just miss one X4
