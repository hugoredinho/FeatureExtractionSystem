[Verse 1]
When everyone thought the world was flat
Columbus said "It's round"
He went down in history
And America was found

[Chorus]
Cause he had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence

[Chorus 2]
With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put them all together and what have you got confidence

[Verse 2]
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
Remember the tortoise and the hare
Who had that famous race
The speedy hare wound up nowhere
And slow poke took first place

[Chorus]
Cause he had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence

[Verse 3]
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
How do you know that you can't ride
A rainbow in the sky
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try

[Chorus]
All we need is confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence

[Chorus 2]
With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put them all together and what have you got confidence
