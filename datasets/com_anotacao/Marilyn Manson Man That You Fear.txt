[Verse 1]
The ants are in the sugar, the muscles atrophied
We're on the other side, the screen is us, and we're TV
Spread me open, sticking to my pointy ribs
Are all your infants in abortion cribs?
I was born into this, everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear

[Chorus]
Pray until your number, asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting, tomorrow's turned up dead

[Verse 2]
I have it all and I have no choice but to
I'll make everyone pay and you will see
You can kill yourself now because you're dead in my mind
The boy that you loved is the monster you fear

[Chorus]
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals

[Post-Chorus]
Pray now, baby
Pray your life was just a dream

[Bridge]
I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape
I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape

[Verse 3]
Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed
Someone had to go this far
I was born into this, everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear

[Chorus]
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals

[Post-Chorus]
Pray now, baby
Pray your life was just a dream
The world in my hands
There's no one left to hear you scream
There's no one left for you

[Outro]
When all your wishes are granted
Many of your dreams will be destroyed
