[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
Today I got a letter from someone
Just a friend we knew some time ago
And as I read between the lines
I began to realize he didn't know
I lost you a long, long time ago

[Verse 2]
Oh I just can't make it any longer
Everything I do is always wrong
I'm living a lie and there's no need in trying
To keep hanging on after all the good is gone

[Verse 3]
Lord, I wish that I could die
And there's no use in trying
To keep hanging on
After all the good is gone
