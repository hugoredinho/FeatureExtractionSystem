[Intro]
I have had my fun if I never get well no more[x2]

[Chorus]
All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

[Verse 1]
Please write my father and tell him the shape I'm in[x2]
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sin
For all of my sin
On the next train south, look for my clothes back home[x2]
Cause all of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

[Chorus]
All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

[Outro]
Feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow[x5]
