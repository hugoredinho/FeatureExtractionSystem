[Verse 1]
As I am strolling down the garden path
I saw a flower glowing in the dark
It looked so pretty and it was unique
I had to bend down just to have a peek

[Chorus]
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

[Verse 2]
I saw you walking underneath the stars
I could not stop cause I was in a car
I am sure the distance would not be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are

[Chorus]
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

[Verse 3]
An old man passed me on the street today
I thought I knew him but I could not say
I stopped to think if I could place his frame
When he tipped his hat I knew his name

[Chorus][x2]
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
