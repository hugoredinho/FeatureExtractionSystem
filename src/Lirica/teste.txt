I'm a bad girl, they all say
Take away my answer and shut my mouth
Bitten underneath that, red-tinged lips
The rebellious streak that I don't hide

I'm not a bad girl, a little different
Just that the other kids' really neat
Knife-edge one-length bob
Doesn't suit me

A night darkened again
My neat square room
Feels like I'm trapped in there again
That's when it knocked on the window
The moonlight shining on me
The sensation as it envelops me

Wo wo wo wo wo
Let's pump it up!

Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Yeah
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
It's all the same huh?
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
It's no fun!
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Wo hoo

Ooh la la, aw why, aw why, aw why
Ooh la la, why why, why not why not
Everybody with me, on the rhythm groove it
Follow your mood, your vibe, why not? Do it!

Let's cast a spell yolo-lo
This splendid night will make tomorrow
Take it to the right, take it to the left
Dance all night, as your heart takes you
Just imagine, it all comes true
The path appears, all on its own
Don't worry what people think, that's important
Don't kill my vibe, that's a no-no

I'm a bad girl, they say again
I guess maybe, I reply
Tangled in that moment's outpour of attention
A look in my eyes that's easily misunderstood

I'm not a bad girl, even more properly
I keep to the line that shouldn't be crossed
Even if it goes against everything
I just hold to my center

The night of the moonlit festival
This rapturous moment
So dazzling, my heart swells
Clock's at twelve right now
I close my eyes
The sensation as it envelops me

Wo wo wo wo wo
Let's pump it up!

Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Yeah
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Where you looking at?
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Just follow me!
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Wo hoo

Ooh la la, aw why, aw why, aw why
Ooh la la, why why, why not why not
Everybody with me, upon the rhythm groove it
Follow your mood, your vibe, why not? Do it!

Midnight dancing dancing dancing dancing dancing ya (One splendid night)
One splendid splendid splendid splendid splendid night

Let's pump it up!

Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Yeah
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Feels like a dream huh? (Yeah yeah why not?)
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Change up everything!
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam

Let's burn it up!!

Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
You know too, huh?
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
It's not a dream!
Di Da Dam Di Dam Di Dam, Dam Dam Dam Di Dam,
Why Not? Do it!
Ooh la la, aw why aw why aw why
Ooh la la, why why, why not why not
