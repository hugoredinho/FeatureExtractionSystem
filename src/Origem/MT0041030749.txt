Sing sweet and low a lullaby, till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem
While wisemen follow through the dark, a star that beckons them
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

A little child shall lead them, the prophets said of old
And storm and tempest heed them until the bell is tolled
Sing sweet and low your lullaby, till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

Sing sweet and low your lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem
