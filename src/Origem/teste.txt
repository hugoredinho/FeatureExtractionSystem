Parts of victims organs
They will give you better style
Attach the platemail to your insides

Blistered by the fire
(Keep your victims confined)
Caught in the threshold
(To meager rations)
Man the armory
(Rations)
Dressed in our
(Those in your basement)
Last attire castle walls
(Keep them confined to meager rations)
Falling down around us all
(To meager rations)

(I stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
And then when you go to sleep
(Stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
I hope you wake up knowing
(Stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
That you were meant for all of this
(Stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
(Stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
(Stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)

First, take time to breathe, you don't need me
(We can't go wrong)
You don't need anything, it's a wonder
(Just hand me the best tongs)
How we're all under attack from everything always
(Paid our dues and now we're gone, now we're gone)
And I'm willing to die to save your life
(We can't go wrong)
I know that you feel the same towards me
(Just hand me the best tongs)
This is the last thing you'll remember
(We can't go wrong, we can't go wrong now)

(Lance her eyes and take one of those dream vacations)
You're saddened to see
(Lance her eyes and take one of those moonlit ocean walks)
Everything you've loved so far is falling right into reach
(Lance her eyes and take one of those dream vacations)
But you're still scared of this rain
(Lance her eyes and take one of those moonlit ocean walks)

First, take time to breathe, you don't need me
(We can't go wrong)
You don't need anything, it's a wonder
(Just hand me the best tongs)
How we're all under attack from everything always
(Paid our dues and now we're gone, now we're gone)
And I'm willing to die to save your life
(We can't go wrong)
I know that you feel the same towards me
(Just hand me the best tongs)
This is the last thing you'll remember
(We can't go wrong, we can't go wrong now)

Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments
Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments
Wear parts of victims organs
They will give you better style
Parts of victims organs just lance her eyes
Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments
Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments
