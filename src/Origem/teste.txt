La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

I know well that you're bad for me
Your eyes and the way you move
I try to get away from you
But being brainwashed, all I can do is nod

I don't hate how your words make my
Feet entangled and dance
Cause I don't want to deny the truth that it was
Destined to be you from the beginning

So elegant, a criminal who hurts me
It's okay, you soothe me just to torture me again
Ooh I'm on a leash called you
It's painful as much as I can't breathe but also magnificent

So elegant, a criminal who destroys me
Not okay, I try and shake my head
Ooh but I'm only getting draggеd in more deeply
The moment I fall for you, is thе end of my innocence

The syndrome called you
You lure me in and shake me
Behind your childlike innocent face
A frightening side of you, gives me goose bumps

My heart with an open wound
Is already full of your fingerprints
My hands holding yours that stabbed me
Are not clean either

So elegant, a criminal who hurts me
It's okay, you soothe me just to torture me again
Ooh I'm on a leash called you
It's painful as much as I can't breathe but also magnificent

So elegant, a criminal who destroys me
Not okay, I try and shake my head
Ooh but I'm only getting dragged in more deeply
The moment I fall for you, is the end of my innocence

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Destroy me more

So elegant, a criminal who hurts me
It's okay, you soothe me just to torture me again
Ooh I'm on a leash called you
It's painful as much as I can't breathe but also magnificent

So elegant, a criminal who destroys me
Not okay, I try and shake my head
Ooh but I'm only getting dragged in more deeply
I don't want to get away, destroy me completely
