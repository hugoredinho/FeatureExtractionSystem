If it was for you I could
Pretend to be happy even when I was sad
If it was for you I could
Pretend to be strong even when I was hurting
I wished that love would only need love to be perfect
That all my flaws would be hidden
In a dream that wouldn't come true
I grew a flower that couldn't bloom

I'm so sick of this Fake Love, Fake Love, Fake Love
I'm so sorry but it's Fake Love, Fake Love, Fake Love

I wanna be a good man just for you
I gave the world just for you
I changed everything just for you
But I dunno me, who are you?
The forest just for us, you weren't there
The route I took, I forgot
I even became quite unsure of who I was
Try babbling into the mirror, who the heck are you?

If it was for you I could
Pretend to be happy even when I was sad
If it was for you I could
Pretend to be strong even when I was hurting
I wished that love would only need love to be perfect
That all my flaws would be hidden
In a dream that wouldn't come true
I grew a flower that couldn't bloom

Love you so bad, Love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it's so mad, Love it's so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, Love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it's so mad, Love it's so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll

I'm so sick of this
Fake Love, Fake Love, Fake Love
I'm so sorry but it's
Fake Love, Fake Love, Fake Love

Why you sad? I don't know. I don't know
Smile, say 'I love you'
Look at me, even I gave up on myself
Even you can't understand me
You say I'm unfamiliar, changed into the one you used to like
You say I'm not myself which you knew well
No? What do you mean no. I'm blind
Love? What the heck is love. It's all fake love

Woo, I dunno, I dunno, I dunno why
Woo, even I, even I don't know myself
Woo, I just know, I just know, I just know why
Cuz it's all Fake Love, Fake Love, Fake Love

Love you so bad, Love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it's so mad, Love it's so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, Love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it's so mad, Love it's so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll

I'm so sick of this
Fake Love, Fake Love, Fake Love
I'm so sorry but it's
Fake Love, Fake Love, Fake Love

If it was for you I could
Pretend to be happy even when I was sad
If it was for you I could
Pretend to be strong even when I was hurting
I wished that love would only need love to be perfect
That all my flaws would be hidden
In a dream that wouldn't come true
I grew a flower that couldn't bloom
