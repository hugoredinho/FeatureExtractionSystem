[Interlude]
Good evening
This is the voice of Enigma
In the next hour, we will take you with us into another world
Into the world of music, spirit, and meditation
Turn off the light, take a deep breath, and relax
Start to move slowly, very slowly
Let the rhythm be your guiding light

Procedamus in pace
In nomine Christi, amen
