Some call it faith, some call it love
Some call it guidance from above
You are the reason we found ours
So thank you, stars
Some people think it's far away
Some know it's with them everyday
You are the reason we found ours
So thank you, stars
There are no winds
That can blow it away on the air
When they try to blow it away
Is when you know it will always be there
To some it's the strength to be apart
To some it's a feeling in the heart
And when you're out there on your own
It's the way back home
There are no winds
That can blow it away on the air
When they try to blow it away
Is when you know it will always be there
Some call it faith, some call it love
Some call it guidance from above
You are the reason we found ours
So thank you, stars
So thank you, stars
So thank you, stars
