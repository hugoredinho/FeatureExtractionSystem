I watched her sleep from the driver's seat
And she turned into an ocean spitting fish into my sea
Oh, how she flickered to remain so young and innocently sweet
And how the secrets in her belly wrestle softly for her keeping

Like the ring that left her finger green
And the knife that sent her shivering body free
Oh, like a knot she tied so sweetly around me
We were aware of our bounderies

Someday I'll meet you on a telephone wire
Won't have to love you through a prayer
I can just touch you with my eyes
And we will talk about the world just as if we were still alive
And you will rest within my feathers
And I will take you for the keeping

And you will fly so sweetly around me
And you will teach me to fly so sweetly around you

And if you talk to Jesus, ask Him if He wants me to come home
If He says He's seen us changing all His plans to suit our own
Will you apologize or stand behind the selfish moves we've made
While learning life is strange and people change and circle round again
