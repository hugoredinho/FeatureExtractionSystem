Love, all you had on your mind
Was a moment in time
And it's here
So we live it
Love, all we want you to find
Was the door closed behind
But it's closed
So you give in
Love, all I want you to do
Is to smile when you're blue
I love you, so believe it
And please, don't you be lonely
All we need is time and we got it
You know the sun will shine if we let it
'Cause it's been so long
Those who've gone before
Fail to find the answer
All we need is time and we got it
You know the sun will shine if we let it
'Cause it's been so long
Those who've gone before
Fail to find the answer
Love, all I ask you to see
Is that when you're with me
I believe there's a heaven
