Tall and tan and young and hansome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking and
When he passes, each girl he passes goes: aah

When he walks, he's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle that
When he passes, each girl he passes goes: aah

But I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him, "I love him?"
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and hansome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking and
When he passes, I smile but he doesn't see, no he doesn't see

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graca
E ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanco a caminho do mar

Moca do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balancado e mais que um poema
E a coisa mais linda que eu ja vi passar..

But I watch her so sadly
Porque tudo e tao triste
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see
Nem olha para mim
She never seem me
Por causa do amor
