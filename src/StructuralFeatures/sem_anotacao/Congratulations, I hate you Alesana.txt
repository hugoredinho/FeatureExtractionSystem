No one ever said that life was fair
And I'm not saying that it should be
So knowing that you are what you want to be and I'm not comes as no surprise
But don't expect me to be happy for you
And don't smile at me and tell me things will work out for me too
I don't want your pity
I hate your pity
Taste your vanity and its sweet bitterness
As you hide behind your veil of
My stolen hopes and lost dreams
(I watched you steal my thoughts)
You took them all
(And had to see you smile)
As you build your dreams
On my shattered hopes
I'll look back on
A day once loved
And fantasize for
Tragedy
Swallow your pity
Beg me to make this easier
And listen to my hopeless cries
Suffer alone
In emptiness
I lust to
See you swallowed by
The mess that
You left in your wake
Disgust lies deep within
Your empty (gaze)
Beg me to make this easier
And listen to my hopeless cries
Send stares into
Your meaningless eyes
My
Envy can't describe how I loathe you
For having all the stars
Leaving my eyes to marvel the sky
Knowing it should be mine
Yet it's you I see wasting the dream
That only I deserve
I'll tear off your face
To see your smile
As you build your dreams
On my shattered hopes
I'll look back on
A day once loved
And fantasize for
Tragedy
Beg me to make this easier
And listen to my hopeless cries
Send stares into
Your meaningless eyes
