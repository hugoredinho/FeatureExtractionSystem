[Verse 1: TRUCIFER]
Okay, let's take a trip down memory lane
Where I wish there was more pleasure than pain
Cause I been through the rain, better yet, hurricanes
But I'll offer you my jacket cause it's a gentleman's thang
Yeah, I'm broken hearted & I'm stressed in the brain
But, if you take a close look, my life's like the wreck of a train
& I still hold onto whatever is left that remains
& I try to make the best of it & hope  y'all get entertained
Fuck settlement rates, sold my soul to the devil
Now I'm in a decadent state but I'm a sensitive case
See I bought myself some benevolent grace
Hoping God reconsiders letting me enter the gates
I'm a positive image stuck in a negative space
& I'm in a delicate place of indefinite shape, punks
I'll spit right on all of you fuckin' prejudiced fakes, you just
Talk so much shit like, "How does the excrement taste?"
Yeah, I'm not a pessimist despite, my tentative face, let's
Get this straight, I'm the one that makes the best of mistakes
You're the one who has a chest full of hate & petulant traits
I never erase, when I write, I write til my pencil tip breaks
See, it's pedal to the medal to get ahead of the game
You're just pressin' the brakes & got no gas left in the tank
Yeah, we're both on Instagram, but we are never the same
Because you rappers are just after the 15 seconds of fame
Wanna take a swing at it? Okay, step to the plate
You would have thought I was playin' chess the way I'm
Checkin' ya, mate, don't hold your breath, just let it escape
You know I'm gonna be one of the best, right next to the greats
Because, when I lay it down, I know how to pick out a rhyme &
Then stretch it out longer than the length of measuring tapes
& I know you don't roll like that, but I'm so smooth
As I spit, it's somethin' sort of as if I'm sleddin' on sleighs
Down the steepest slope of snow but, when I step on the stage
I just set it ablaze, "Attention: We need some Medical Aid"
When I'm in the dog house I got bitches spreadin' their legs
You woulda thought I was God the way I was gettin' appraised
But, every other day is just another test of my faith, so I kiss
The ground & thank God, that I'm not dead in a grave
I been gettin' fresher, with every single last breath that I take
Just to make sure y'all remember the name, yeah
I am the next renegade
