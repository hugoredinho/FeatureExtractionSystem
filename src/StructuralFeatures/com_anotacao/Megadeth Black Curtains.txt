[Verse 1]
Hey, look around you
Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up, I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang, it happened
Time's up, Armageddon
Fire, meltdown
The sky is crumbling in

[Chorus]
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains

[Verse 2]
Escape, you're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate is coming
Welcome it with a smile

[Chorus]
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains fall
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains

[Spoken]
"Something's under my skin
Something's very strange
Playing with my mind
Tempting me to do you in."

[Bridge]
Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom in a spider's web
Suffocating, no one hears my calls
Never-ending, 'til the black curtain falls

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Snakes surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down, I'm drowning
How long?, I hold my breath
Dogs are chasing
My legs are paralysed
Pray, don't find me
My life is fading fast

[Chorus]
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains fall
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains
