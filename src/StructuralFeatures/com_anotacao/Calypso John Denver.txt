[Verse 1]
To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean
To ride on the crest of the wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and the living
In search of the answers to questions unknown
To be part of the movement and part of the growing
Part of beginning to understand

[Chorus]
Aye, Calypso, the place's you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well

[Verse 2]
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and show us the way
For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be

[Chorus]
Aye, Calypso, the place's you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well
Aye, Calypso, the place's you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well
