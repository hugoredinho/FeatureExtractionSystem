Yo. Brooklyn’s back so they get tight. Uh. (uh)
Stuck on go, no respite. Yea. (uh)
Imma kill this, you guessed right. Ooouu. (forreal)
Can’t control what I write, no. (forreal)
My pen and mind in the zone
Freestyle, or I spit it right off the dome
I’m a good guy, but I’m also bad to the bone
I’m the BK Fresh King, everywhere I go. (yuh)
Don’t fuck with me, just fuck with me
I treat this beat like it’s Kenny. (hm)
I got henny on my block
I dougie and milli rock. (milly rock milly rock yuh)
Put some rocks up in my watch
Time go fast, it tick then tock. Yea. (vroom vroom)
Imma drink a forty when I’m forty
Have a little shorty with my shawty when I’m fucking lit
I am all that and a bag of chips, with dip, no shit. You can sit
I used to be so lame, but now I am so cool. (OK)
Amazing what a little confidence can do. (OK)
I got plans and a vision, gotta see em thru. (ooh)
You hating, and wanna see me lose. (ooh)
We lightning strike that stage like Zeus
They all go dumb, just like we do. (that's dangerous!)
Brooklyn so rambunctious. Damn
Fucking up the function. Ooouu
Catch me in math class (doing what), fucking up the functions. (OK)
This beat was my lunch. Damn, that shit was scrumptious. (DELICIOUS)

(Pragmatic)
Said I want cash for the count
Massive amounts (oh shit)
And I got bags in a drought
Dragging em out (too fast)
Gotta show, packing em out
Then I'm back at the house
Demons you know
That I'm casting em out
Cause I'm heaven sent
Why is you reticent (heavenly)
Feedback is all for your betterment (betterment)
Know that the word of God
It be my medicine (yeah)
Keeping me treading water
Never settling (never settling)
I ain't never seen
But believe the king
Can be the reason
A fiend make a change in they life (forreal)
I ain't never seen
But I mean
The change happened to me
When I traded in the wrong
For the right
Walking by the faith
Bet it all for my sight
Never blind even
In the midst of the night (can't see)
Holy water misting my pistons
Moved for the mission
Who in my crew be defenseless
Tell me what it do
Wanna work meet me in the stu
Ain't no starving
We getting food
Breaking all the rules
Feeling like a relative of Duke
Got me in a sentimental mood
But they're some things I can't stand
Like you making these assumptions
Bumping Andy in the trap
It got me feeling so rambunctious
Yeah my team we move low-key
Like a ship that had sunken
But ascending way past Everest
You know we up to something
Nah wa I mean, get that green
Money pine-sol bet it's clean
I royal court my vision
Can't be jack without the king

We got the game on lock
Young padawan
Learn from a master (jedi)
Been thru the trials and tribulations
Kept my head high no complaining
I could see the light from the basement (forreal)
Started with NXT LVL never basic
Ain’t no competition who you racing (ooh)
I can smell defeat like a pastry
It’s forbidden fruit never tasted (nah)
Worst nightmare Freddy Jason (oh no)
With the music call me Rambo
First blood then I wash my hands off
I could never understand y’all
Weak bars cannot hold ya bands up (whatchu saying)
I’m dealing with the longevity
Need my wealth seated up heavenly
While you sit back like u Ellen D. (Ellen D)
