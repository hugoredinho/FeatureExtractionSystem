[Verse 1]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
Two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
No sacrifice, at all

[Verse 2]
Mutual misunderstandings
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
Two hearts livin'
In two separate world
And, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
No sacrifice, at all

[Outro]
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
