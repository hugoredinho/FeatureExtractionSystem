[Verse 1]
6:00am, day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping, I am numb

[Verse 2]
Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out

[Pre-Chorus]
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

[Chorus]
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

[Verse 3]
They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot
Then I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for?
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

[Chorus]
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

[Bridge]
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, "Son, it's time to tell the truth"
And she broke down and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying

[Verse 4]
Driving back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone, and I'm alone
And now I know it

[Chorus]
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
