[Verse 1]
Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in two

[Verse 2]
Somehow through the days I don't give in
I hide the tears that wait till then
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart again

[Instrumental Verse]

[Bridge]
Why did you go? Why did you go?
Don't you know, don't you know
I need you?

[Verse 1]
Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in two

[Outro]
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in two
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in two
