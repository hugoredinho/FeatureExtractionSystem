[Verse 1]
So goddamn easy to write this
You make it spill on the page
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous
The laughing stock of your own fucking stage

[Pre-Chorus]
But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

[Chorus]
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me

[Verse 2]
Just one time you got a reason
Heard you had nothing to lose
A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation
It must be easy to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

[Chorus]
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me

[Bridge]
You can tell the same lie a thousand times
But it never gets anymore true
So close your eyes once more and once more believe
That they all still believe in you
Just one time

[Chorus]
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
Just one time

[Outro]
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me
Just one time
You try me
Just one time
You try me
You try me
