[Intro]
They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious
They were sitting
They were talking on the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing
Cold, cold water
Bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?

[Chorus]
When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

[Verse]
I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing
People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away

[Chorus]
When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

[Instrumental Bridge]
Ah

[Outro]
Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Well the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away
Well, the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
