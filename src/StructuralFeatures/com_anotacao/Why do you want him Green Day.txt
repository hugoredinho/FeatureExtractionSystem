[Verse 1]
I saw you standing alone
With a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone
Looks like he left without a trace
Tears falling outta your eyes
He's living in a disguise
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

[Chorus]
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?

[Verse 2]
Now many days have gone by
You still just sit there and cry
You're feeling bad for yourself
His memory will always dwell
You're so obsessed with his love
That's why push came to shove
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

[Chorus]
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?

[Bridge]
I thought a way out
Throw it all away
Just think about
Yeah, something to say

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
