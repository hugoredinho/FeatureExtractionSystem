[Hook]
I don't gotta drive cars
I don’t gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I float around like I’m from Mars
Cause, cause I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I float around like I'm from Mars
Cause, cause I don't gotta drive cars
I don’t gotta drive cars
I don’t gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don’t gotta drive cars

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to the castle, currently opening satchels
Baby you are mine, don't be dull
They talk too much shit, they be talking bull
Talking bulling bulk, yo bitch she wanna sulk
I'm a soldier I can tell yeah I know
I'm a soldier I can tell yeah I know
She said "where you been baby?"
I been stalking you on the web
I’m not shooting at you like the feds
I might bag you and put you in beds
Anime girl sad, vampire boy gonna get some head
[?] I don't drink lean I just drink Sprite
I'm a nuisance, I'm a lil bent
I'm a lil tent, these niggas under me
I'm not no [?] you ain't got shit on me
I change the cemetery to the whole community

[Outro]
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I float around like I'm from Mars
Cause, cause I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
I don't gotta drive cars
