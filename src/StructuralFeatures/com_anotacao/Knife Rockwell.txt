[Verse 1]
You touched my life
With the softness in the night
My wish was your command
Until you ran out of love
I tell myself I'm free
Got the chance of living just for me
No need to hurry home
Now that you're gone

[Chorus]
Knife, cuts like a knife
How will I ever heal?
I'm so deeply wounded
Knife, cuts like a knife
You cut away the heart of my life

[Verse 2]
When I pretend wear a smile
To fool my dearest friends
I wonder if they know, it's just a show
I'm on a stage, day and night
I go through my charades
But how can I disguise what's in my eyes?

[Chorus]
Knife, cuts like a knife
How will I ever heal?
I'm so deeply wounded
Knife, cuts like a knife
You cut away the heart of my life

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
I've tried and tried
Blocking out the pain I feel inside
The pain of wanting you
Wanting you

[Chorus 2]
Knife, cuts like a knife
How will I ever heal?
I'm so deeply wounded
Knife, cuts like a knife
How will I ever heal?
I'm so deeply wounded

[Outro]
You cut away the heart of my life
