[Chorus 1]
War
What is it good for? Absolutely nothing
Say it again, war
What is it good for? Absolutely nothing, come on

[Verse 1]
War is something that i despise
For it means destruction of innocent lives
And thousands words in mothers' cry
When their son's go out to fight to give their lives

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
War
It ain't nothing but a heart-breaker
War
Friend only to the undertaker

[Verse 2]
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war it just blows my mind
Handed down from generation to generation
Induction, destruction, who wants to die?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled bitter and mean
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
War can't give life it can only take it away

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Peace, love and understanding it all
There must be some place for these things today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But lord there's gotta be another way that's better than

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Outro]
I'm talking about war
