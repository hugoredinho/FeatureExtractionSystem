[Verse 1: Marianne Faithful]
And under the boughs unbowed
All holding a snowy shroud
She had no heart, so hardened
All under the boughs unbowed

[Verse 2: Marianne Faithful 
& Nick Cave
]
Each feather, it fell from skin
'Til threadbare and she grew thin
How were my eyes so blinded?
Each feather, it fell from skin

[Chorus: Marianne Faithful 
& Nick Cave
]
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will 
hang my head
Hang my head low

[Verse 3: Marianne Faithful 
& Nick Cave
]
A gray sky with bitter skin
A rain cloud
 would rain on me
All out behind horizon, ohh
A gray sky of bitter skin

[Chorus: Marianne Faithful & Nick Cave]
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low
And I will hang my head
Hang my head low

[Outro:  Marianne Faithful 
& Nick Cave
]
And under the boughs unbowed
All holding a snowy shroud
She had no heart, so hardened
All the boughs unbowed
