[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Ayo, Jim, man, why don't ya…
Why don't you kick some of that, you know?
You- you know how you do it, man, 
it's a trip
People don't even believe we're together right now (Whoa)
Bu-, bu-, but tell your story
You know the one I like (Ride, ride, ride)
Say it for me

[Hook: Jim Morrison & (Snoop Dogg)]
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
Into this house we're born (Into this house we're born)
Into this world we're thrown (Into this world we're thrown)
Like a dog without a bone (Woof, woof)
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
There's a killer on the road (Killer, killer, road, road, road)
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday (Holidays, holidays)
Let your children play (C'me here and play)
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die (Ride, ride, ride)
Killer on the road (Killer, road, road, road, road, road)
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Goin' off of this, goin' off of that
With the Lizard king bumpin' in the back, how 'bout that?
Driftin', liftin', swiftin' (Let 'em in. let 'em in)
Coastin', 
testaroastin'
But the wheels won't stop
200 on the highway, fresh up off the block
He's a rider? (Woo, woo) Naw, he's a killer
Dressed in all black, but his hat says Steeler (Steeler, Steeler)
Pedal to the metal (Metal)
I gotta go hard, drive by and say hello
Hey, 
Fredwreck
, you my mello
Now let me hear what I sound like acapella
(Shh) Wow, ride, dip swish now
Bring it back just like this
Like a dog without his bone
Unlike a G without his chrome; it's hard to imagine
The homie dog in a 
Jag
And he's checkin' for the checkered flagin'
Comin' in first, never in last
Cause my car too fast (Zoom, zoom)
I never ever run outta gas
Cause I'm just too clean, I do it upperclass
So fasten your seat belts
It's so hot, it will even make heat melt (Woo, woo)
So get a bowl and roll and ride
Slip through the slip and slide

[Hook: Jim Morrison]
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Woah!
Away in India
Woo!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Need for speed, I'm tryin' to take the lead
Hold on, little homie, 'fore you run into the trees (Watch out! Watch out!)
I've seen things that I never would've saw before
Ayo, Jim, let 'em in, let 'em in
Open up, my back tire smokin' up
The whole street, 
and now the police (Wuuh, wuuh)
Wanna flash their lights
And chase the Dogg all night (Woof!)
But I won't pull over nor give up
‘Cause I just don't give a (What?)
Yeah, I'm from the side, boy
Where we was born and raised straight up to ride, boy (West Side)
Continuously, we get to it expeditiously
Keep the light on, East side on
Snoop Dogg and the Doors and, yeah, we 'bout to ride on

[Hook: Jim Morrison]
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

[Outro: Jim Morrison]
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
And let's ride! (Wow! Yeah!)
