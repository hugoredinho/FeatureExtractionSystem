[Verse 1]
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low

[Chorus]
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Verse 2]
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a Robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost his will to live

[Chorus]
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are

[Chorus]
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry
