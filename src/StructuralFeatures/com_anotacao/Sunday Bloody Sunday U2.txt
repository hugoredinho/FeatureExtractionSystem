[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away

[Chorus]
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

[Refrain]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Alright, let's go!

[Verse 3]
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

[Refrain]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Chorus]
How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

[Refrain]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Come get some!

[Bridge]
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your bloodshot eyes

[Refrain]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Verse 4]
And it's true, we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today, the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow, they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
Onâ€”

[Refrain]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
