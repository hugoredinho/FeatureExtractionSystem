[Verse 1]
Look now
Just because we can't seem to get along
Without breaking the rules
Doesn't mean we can't walk on the wild side
Doesn't mean we can't talk on the dirty side

[Verse 2]
This malnutrition you've forced upon everyone
Is still eating away at your insides
Fill your mind with this idiosyncrasy
Fill your head with indigenous lies

[Hook]
Shut up
Get down
You're blowing our cover
Shut up
Get down
Shut up
Get down
You're blowing our cover
Shut up
Get down

[Verse 3]
A startling glance at the future and past
In our games we hide
In our ways we surpass but
In all of my life
I've found nothing like this

[Verse 4]
Your contribution has hoarded the masses now
And the thieves have decided to hide
Ante up cause the enemy's coming
And get your gun cause I'm already reloading

[Outro]
Arm yourselves, arm yourselves
Arm yourselves, arm yourselves
Arm yourselves, arm yourselves
Arm yourselves, arm yourselves
Arm yourselves, arm yourselves
Arm yourselves, arm yourselves
