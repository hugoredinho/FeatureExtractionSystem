[Verse 1]
Y'all know about sixty-nine
Burnin' bones and bedside time
Once again we meet tonight
Get that touch of a magical light

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break out through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice

[Chorus]
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom

[Verse 2]
The time is right for a ride tonight
To be with you I'd risk a fight
My stick is tight, my blood is hot
Let's do it here, right on the spot

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break out through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice

[Chorus]
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
