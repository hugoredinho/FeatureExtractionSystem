[Verse 1]
Crushing all your worthless goals
I define control
Your pain's my fucking ecstasy
So putrid is my world of tyranny

[Bridge 1]
Accentuate your desperation
Flesh from bone, I'll rip and tear
I hate the fact that we breathe the same air

[Verse 2]
Helpless as I dominate
I won't celebrate
Until you've all been crucified
I cannot rest 'till everyone has died

[Bridge 2]
I can't stand the victim in you
Infecting everything that I do
I will eradicate
Obliterate, depopulate
Divine, atrocious suffering
Cleansation of the weak, supremacy

[Bridge 3]
Pissing on your faith
Incinerate God's whore
Perpetual is my reign
I will eat your soul

[Lead - King]

[Refrain]
Must maintain control of the weak

[Lead - Hanneman]

[Outro]
Must maintain control of the weak
Must contain the minds of the free
Must maintain control of the weak
Must contain the minds of the free
Must maintain control of the weak
