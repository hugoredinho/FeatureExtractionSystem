[Chorus]
I said the joint was rocking
Uh, going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well it sounds so sweet
I had to take me a chance
Rose out of my seat
I just had to dance
Started moving my feet
Whoa to clapping my hands

[Chorus]
I said the joint was a rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Yeah at twelve o'clock
Yeah, the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Yeah the place was packed
And when the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But they kept on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound

[Chorus]
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
And they go on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

Well the joint stayed a rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Instrumental]
