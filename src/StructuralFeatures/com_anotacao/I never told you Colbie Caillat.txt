[Verse 1]
I miss those blue eyes
How you kiss me at night
I miss the way we sleep
Like there's no sunrise
Like the taste of your smile
I miss the way we breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in

[Chorus]
And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe it, I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you

[Verse 2]
I see your blue eyes
Every time I close mine
You make it hard to see
Where I belong to
When I'm not around you
It's like I'm not with me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in

[Chorus]
And now I miss everything about you (Still, you're gone)
I can't believe it, I still want you
(Having loving you, I never should've walked away)
After all the things we've been through
(I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you, whoa
(Oh, no)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in

[Chorus]
And now I miss everything about you (Still, you're gone)
I can't believe it, I still want you
(Having loving you, I never should've walked away)
After all the things we've been through
(I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you, whoa

[Outro]
Oh no, no
Mmm, no
Mmmm
