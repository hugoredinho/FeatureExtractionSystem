[Verse 1]
You give me your smile
A piece of your heart
You give me the feel I've been looking for
You give me your soul
Your innocent love
You are the one I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for
We're lost in a kiss
A moment in time
Forever young
Just forever, just forever in love

[Chorus]
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
It was love at first sight
All the way
When you came into my life
The world was not the same, oh no
Because your love has found it's way
Into my heart, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You make me dream
By the look in your eyes
You give me the feel, I've been longing for
I've been longing for so long

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just forever in love

[Verse 3]
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And was love at first sight
All the way

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When you came into my life
