[Verse 1]
Somewhere in a winter night
The angels begin their flight
Dark skies with miles to go
No footsteps to be lost in snow

[Hook]
They fly to you
Oh, new-born king
They fly to you
Oh, angels sing

[Bridge]
One is sorrow, one is peace
One will come to give you sleep
One is comfort, one is grief
One will take, the tears you weep

[Verse 2]
New star in a midnight sky
In heaven all the angels fly
Soft wings so true and all things
They will give to you

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Somewhere in a winter night
The angels begin their flight

[Verse 4]
Tonight all sing
Oh, angels, a new-born king
Tonight all sing
Oh, angels, a new-born king
