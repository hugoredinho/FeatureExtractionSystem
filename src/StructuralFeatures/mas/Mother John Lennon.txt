[Verse 1]
Mother, you had me but I never had you
I wanted you, you didn't want me
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Father, you left me but I never left you
I needed you, you didn't need me
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 3]
Children, don't do what I have done
I couldn't walk and I tried to run
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

[Outro]
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
Mama don't go, Daddy come home
