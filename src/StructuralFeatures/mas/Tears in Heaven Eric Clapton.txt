[Verse 1]
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

[Verse 2]
Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

[Bridge]
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven

[Verse 4]
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong
Here in heaven
